**Scientific conferences and meetings have an important role in research, but they also suffer from disadvantages that are barriers to the open and inclusive nature that is the ideal of many scientists. In particular, they can have prohibitive costs (financial, time away from home, carbon footprint) and they are often viewed as exclusive by scientists and trainees on the outside of existing powerful social networks. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the cancellation of many conferences, forcing the scientific community to explore online alternatives. The Neuromatch Conference (NMC) vision is to foster inclusive global interactions for learning, mentorship, networking, and professional development in neuroscience through online community interactions and events.**

In the spring of 2020, there were two Neuromatch conferences that primarily focused on the computational neuroscience community. The events were successful and vibrant demonstrations of what can happen when the ideals of openness and inclusivity are used to rethink the conference experience. Following this, our partner organization Neuromatch Academy introduced a wildly successful global summer school experience. At the heart of these endeavors are the full exploitation of modern technology (including the Neuromatch algorithm, which links scientists according to text corpora analysis) to replace and enhance the most positive and beneficial aspects of interactions between scholars. NMC3 was run in the fall of 2020 with a wider scope of all neuroscience research.

We are planning to run NMC4 in early December of 2021 which will be revisting our roots in the computational neuroscience community. The event will be of a similar scale as the NMC1 and NMC2.

We hope that our efforts will give a sustainable way to increase the openness, transparency, diversity and inclusivity in global scientific conferences both within neuroscience as well as other disciplines. Please take a look at abstract submission and key dates, registration, and agenda information. Come join us!
