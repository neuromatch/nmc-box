rec01aHMWBgudGF6r,Mind-body relationships and neuroscientific frameworks: a pluralistic proposal based on cultural anthropology,"Mind/body dualism — or the question of the mind’s origins — is a problem central to the development of Western cognitive science. Can the mind be disentangled from the physical entity which exists in the time and space continuum that is associated with mental phenomena? The majority of Western thinkers have operated within this framework of discreteness and separability of notions related to the mind itself. 
However, there is an alternative approach to the mind-body problem, based in the worldview of nomadic civilizations of Eurasia. A relatively unknown framework of thought is characteristic for people who practice transhumance — a type of pastoralist livestock herding in Eurasia. Transhumance remains well-preserved in the knowledge and language of ethnic groups of the region. Namely, it has an innate linguistic intractability: there is no separation of abstract notions (e.g., “mind” uses the same word as “consciousness”, “advice”, “memory”).  
In my argument, I will refer to the historical discourse of censorship and colonialism, which hindered the spread and, perhaps, even the possibility of conceptualization of the nomadic world view. As such, I will briefly explore the syncretic relationships between Tengrism, Islam, and other frameworks of cosmological thought which, along with the nature of the nomadic lifestyle, inform the details of the cognitive framework. 
After introducing the elements of nomadic civilization, I will provide a brief comparative analysis of the main Western schools of thought using the nomadic “structureless” frame of mind. Concise, yet informative, juxtapositions of views enable the differences to be seen in terms more closely approximated to the Western images of dualistic entities. Thus, my analysis provides a basis for traditionally omitted paradigms of philosophy, and may give rise to a new system of categorization of philosophical notions.

rec02CWKxInzvRurN,"Resting State fMRI Connectivity in Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and Healthy Controls","Working Abstract:

Ongoing thought patterns, emerging from a collection of dynamically-connected neural systems, represent rich data that may contain valuable biomarkers for healthy vs. abnormal human cognition.  In the distinction between neurotypical and abnormal brain function, connectivity analyses of resting-state fMRI data (rsfMRI) provide non-invasive biobehavioral estimations of functional connectonomics, which can then be aggregated for comparisons across demographic and diagnostic variables.  The development and maturation of these computational connectivity analyses is promising for translational neuroscience, as a diagnostic tool to predict outcomes and optimize treatment selection, as well as for basic research, to advance the understanding of both healthy brain function and the evolving conceptualization of some mental disorders as heterogeneous “circuitopathies”, with distinct subtypes differentiated by individual circuits of disfunction.
In our current research, we investigate models of resting-state connectivity in fMRI data of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and healthy controls (SZ, BP, HC; respectively), using Dynamic Graphical Models (DGMs).  These multilinear models allow the estimation of directed connectivity, such that parent-child node connections are reported.  Our data has been previously collected as part of research at the Norwegian Centre for Mental Disorders Research (NORMENT).  At this stage in the research, we are using a DGM to investigate group differences between the SZ, BP, and HC groups.",Daniel Brown,"Daniel Brown, University of Oslo, Haakon Engen, NORMENT",University of Oslo (grid.5510.1),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-29 12:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 12:15:00+00:00,

rec0Jg1vlRBuPZAs5,Predictive mechanisms are involved in perceptual stability across saccades,"It has been suggested that perceptual stability across saccades relies on predictive mechanisms. Specifically, predictions of what should occur after the saccade modulate our perception of the visual scene once the saccade has been executed.
To investigate this, we measured how perceptual discrimination of a visual target at a peripheral location before saccading to it, is influenced by changes in the visual scene after the saccade. Participants’ task was to discriminate a symbol at a peripheral location, before saccading to it. We manipulated information in the visual scene after the saccade in various ways (removal, change in identity or shifts). Because changes after the saccade were irrelevant to the task, we hypothesized that changes in discrimination performance, if any, could only be attributable to disrupted comparisons between our pre-saccadic expectation and our post-saccadic perception of the visual scene. We observed that the disappearance of the saccade goal target, without the disappearance of the surrounding stimuli, reduced the discrimination performance compared to baseline. Importantly, discrimination performance remained unchanged when the entire visual scene, including or excluding the saccade goal target, was removed. These results support the idea that discrimination decreases are not due to abrupt changes affecting memory of the target. It also suggests that removal of the visual scene does not disrupt predictive mechanisms, likely because changes are correctly attributed to the external world. 
We also observed that shifts in the position of the saccade goal target after the saccade disrupted discrimination performance to a much greater degree when the position shifted outside the distribution of saccade endpoints both parallel and perpendicular to the target. This supports the notion of predictive mechanisms taking saccade-related motor noise into account when comparing pre- and post- visual target information, thus involved in the perception of a visual scene across saccades.

rec0LlLv3pw1uaxXv,Is the brain macroscopically linear? A system identification of resting state dynamics,"A central challenge in the computational modeling of neural dynamics is the trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. At the level of individual neurons, nonlinear dynamics are both experimentally established and essential for neuronal functioning. One may therefore expect the collective dynamics of massive net- works of such neurons to only increase in their complexity, thereby supporting an expanded repertoire of nonlinear behaviors. An implicit assumption has thus formed that an “accurate” computational model of whole-brain dynamics must inevitably be nonlinear whereas linear models may provide a first-order approximation. To what extent this assumption holds, however, has remained an open question. Here, we provide a rigorous and data-driven answer at the level of whole-brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and macroscopic field potential dynamics by leveraging the theory of system identification. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), we model the spon- taneous, resting state activity of 700 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 122 subjects from the Restoring Active Memory (RAM) project using state-of-the-art linear and nonlinear model fam- ilies. We assess relative model fit using predictive power, computational complexity, and the extent of residual dynamics unexplained by the model. Contrary to our expectations, linear auto-regressive models achieve the best measures across all three metrics, eliminating the trade-off between accuracy and simplic- ity. To understand and explain this linearity, we highlight four properties of macroscopic neurodynamics which can counteract or mask microscopic nonlinear dynamics: averaging over space, averaging over time, observation noise, and limited data samples. Whereas the latter two are technological limitations and can improve in the future, the former two are inherent properties of aggregate macroscopic brain activity. Our results demonstrate the discounted potential of linear models in accurately capturing macroscopic brain dynamics. This, together with the unparalleled interpretability of linear models, can greatly facilitate our understanding of macroscopic neural dynamics, which in turn may facilitate the principled design of model-based interventions for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",Erfan Nozari,Jennifer Stiso; Lorenzo Caciagli; Eli J.

rec0OncnEzJqdHHwz,Simulation-based inference of neural models from large-scale single-neuron electrophysiology,"Mechanistic models are useful tools in neuroscience for testing whether proposed mechanisms are consistent with experimental data. Further, biophysically-detailed neural models can help infer parameters that are not easily measurable, such as ionic channel densities. Recent advances in likelihood-free statistical inference have given neuroscientists the opportunity to use both these biophysically-detailed models and statistical inference in their analyses. We test a new inference tool, which incorporates these recent advances, on the Allen Institute Cell Types Database. Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE) is a tool for fast identification of model parameters consistent with both a chosen prior distribution and experimental data. SNPE trains an artificial neural network on synthetic data, using this trained network to estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters from experimental data. Previous studies have tested SNPE on a homogenous set of experimental protocols. For this study, we explore the viability of SNPE in a different context, by testing SNPE on a more diverse set of experiments. Our test dataset is derived from surgical samples from the human brain, with neurons tested adaptively at different current levels. To accommodate this diverse dataset, we use high-level features that generalize across experimental sweeps, rather than features from a particular neuron's voltage trace. We simulate two neural models, with parameters drawn from an informed prior distribution, and compute these high-level features from this synthetic data. With these synthetic features and SNPE, we conduct amortized simulation-based inference (SBI) on our dataset. We find that our amortized SBI across this dataset produces models inconsistent with the electrophysiological data, using both a reduced and conductance-based model. These inconsistent results show the difficulties of using SNPE in this new context, the sensitivity of SBI to feature selection, and the challenge of selecting a prior.

rec0tAcvdlC6mm4Db,Transcriptomic Analysis of the brains of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s Patients,"Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s diseases (Asym-AD) is a condition where patients have intact cognition but neuropathology similar to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Studying the genome-wide expression of transcripts in Asym-AD brains could help us understand the molecular mechanisms that play a role in the onset of AD. Microarray expression counts from the entorhinal, temporal, cerebellum and frontal regions of the brain is taken for AD, Asym-AD and Normal (control) patients collected from the GEO database. The gene expression of the three conditions are compared as three different cases: AD versus Asym-AD, AD versus control and Asym-AD versus control. All analysis was done using the R software. Differential gene expression (DGE) and Co-expression is first done to analyse the abnormalities in the transcriptome. Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is done to find out the significant pathways and modules. Finally, protein-protein interaction networks are constructed to identify potential network hubs for targeting. Neuronal pathways including postsynaptic signal transduction, transmission across synapses and release of neurotransmitters were affected in all cases, and some interesting pathways such as Innate immunity and Neutrophil degranulation was found to be altered in the Asymptomatic AD versus control case. This could suggest an immunological basis for the Asymptomatic AD as a cause or direct side effect of AD neuropathology.

rec0wKH3JAH6t4aO4,Investigating activity-dependent processes in cortical neuronal assembly and in developmental epileptic encephalopathy,"The cerebral cortex contains an extraordinary diversity of excitatory projection neuron (PN) and inhibitory interneurons (IN), wired together to form complex circuits.

Despite the recent groundbreaking discovery of spontaneous activity in the embryonic brain, it is still unclear whether early activity contributes to shape subtype-specific neuronal identity. Trough in utero genetic perturbation and pharmacological inhibition of selected ion channels, known to control excitability, we aim at identify the activity-regulated processes controlling the development of different cortical PN classes and their wiring. Our project aims at dissecting the contribution of activity-dependent processes in the acquisition of subtype specific features of developing cortical neurons, trough in vivo genetic manipulation of distinct channels known to be regulator of neuronal excitability and/or associated with developmental epileptic encephalopathy.

rec0wzVuSGzJbypkG,Neural representations of  social placebo effect,"Abstract
Knowing the efficacy of administrated treatment is critical for inducing placebo effect. For example, giving treatment with full information could enable better therapeutic effect than just administrating treatment in hidden way. Even fake pill with “effective” descriptions would produce therapeutic-like effects. One fascinating question would be: how human brain could encode and represent treatment-related information to generate placebo responses? In the current study, we answered this question within the framework of social placebo effect (SPE), a latest placebo effect that can facilitate social functioning. Specifically, we examined the spontaneous representation and information-based representation by adopting resting-state and concepts representation task. Behavioral measurement was also adopted to confirm the placebo responses. We found that the spontaneous representation for treatment information has enhanced functional connectivity within social brain network, as well as between vmPFC and superior frontal gyrus. Further, in concepts representation task, treatment’s efficacy was represented in vmPFC, left middle frontal, right lateral orbitofrontal cortex with more distinct and finer-grained pattern in placebo condition. Finally, combing neural indices and behavioral indices, participants in placebo condition can be discriminated from control condition with a classification accuracy of 89%. Our study revealed the potential neural mechanisms for explaining why giving treatment information would induce placebo effect in multiple perspectives. These findings may further contribute to the way to manipulate effectiveness of treatment in clinical practice.

rec18CGQWe9NL8Q8T,Dendritic Activity in Area CA3 of the Mouse Hippocampus,"Hippocampal “place cells” are tuned to locations in an environment, much as sensory cortices encode features of their respective modalities. Hippocampal cells also exhibit the phenomenon of remapping, in which a cell codes for different positions in different environments, or different positions in the same environment, when task demands change. Remapping occurs on fast timescales, so typical plasticity mechanisms cannot completely explain this behavior.
Recent studies implicate dendritic spikes in predicting the formation of stable place fields. However, due to technical and analytical limitations, in vivo studies of hippocampal dendritic activity have largely been confined to basal or proximal apical dendrites. To address these issues, our lab has developed an experimental paradigm in which the basal dendrites, cell bodies, and apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in area CA3 are imaged in the same focal plane. We imaged calcium activity, reported by GCaMP6f or GCaMP7b, simultaneously in pyramidal cell bodies and dendrites while head-fixed mice ran for water rewards on a treadmill track. 
To interpret this data, we developed an automated algorithm to identify dendritic and somatic regions of interest (ROIs) from the calcium signal. The algorithm matches manually-labeled datasets and identifies many more dendritic segments than a human expert. The algorithm is easily applied to detecting ROIs from various interneuron populations as well as axonal data, and runs faster than real-time on a standard desktop computer, with very few free parameters to tune.
When we analyzed the compartment-specific tuning of neurons, we discovered an interesting feature that the dendrites of a neuron may be tuned to completely different locations than their sister dendrites or their parent soma. Furthermore, the internal routing of information, - which dendrites are highly correlated with the soma, - was often changed during remapping. These results suggest that dendrites may enable a neuron to hold multiple pieces of information, and a subset of that information is routed to the soma, perhaps in a context-dependent manner.

rec18c1EMrPpUfL4K,The influence of FUS on axonal mRNA localisation and local protein synthesis in neurodegenerative disease,"The phase-separating RNA-binding protein FUS is associated with familial forms of motor neuron disease and frontotemporal dementia. Disease-linked mutations have been shown to result in the protein adopting a poorly soluble and fibrillar hydrogel-like state [1,2]. However, the pathological significance of this aggregation is unknown. Potentially, entrapment of mRNAs and proteins in such aggregates contributes to axonal degeneration by compromising trafficking or local protein synthesis (LPS).
In this project, we investigate this hypothesis. In particular, we are combining a range of advanced imaging techniques to probe structural changes to the axonal cytoskeleton, which is required to maintain cell structure and transport and is partly supported by LPS. To this purpose, we investigate changes in cell shape and LPS in cultured Xenopus laevis retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. We aim to link these observations to in vivo cell shape changes by investigating changes in RGC axonal branching. Furthermore, by tracking labelled RNA in RGC axons, we are quantifying the changes in dynamics of axonal transport. We will additionally measure changes in local translation of all mRNAs as well as of specific candidates using a combination of staining and live-cell imaging techniques.

We report on a new open access template of the marmoset cortex (the Nencki–Monash, or NM template), representing a morphological average of 20 brains of young adult individuals, obtained by 3D reconstructions generated from Nissl-stained serial sections. The method used to generate the template takes into account morphological features of the individual brains, as well as the borders of clearly defined cytoarchitectural areas. This has resulted in a resource which allows direct estimates of the most likely coordinates of each cortical area, as well as quantification of the margins of error involved in assigning voxels to areas, and preserves quantitative information about the laminar structure of the cortex. We provide spatial transformations between the NM and other available marmoset brain templates, thus enabling integration with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tracer-based connectivity data. The NM template combines some of the main advantages of histology-based atlases (e.g. information about the cytoarchitectural structure) with features more commonly associated with MRI-based templates (isotropic nature of the dataset, and probabilistic analyses). The underlying workflow may be found useful in the future development of brain atlases that incorporate information about the variability of areas in species for which it may be impractical to ensure homogeneity of the sample in terms of age, sex and genetic background.

rec1HW5BeOhRLiRL2,Differential modular dynamics in marmoset cortex during conscious and unconscious states,"Consciousness is the state of wakefulness and awareness characterised by the ability to sense and respond to stimuli. In recent years, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying consciousness has been greatly improved by the study of unconsciousness with general anaesthetics. While much of this work has focused on the cellular effects of anaesthesia, several recent studies have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate whole-brain, network-level changes linked to these cellular effects. The dynamics of whole-brain states have been shown to differ between periods of consciousness and unconsciousness, with a smaller repertoire of brain states observed during unconsciousness, and fewer transitions between these states (Barttfeld et al, PNAS, 2015). These whole-brain analyses have been invaluable for characterising the systems-level bases of consciousness, providing evidence for theoretical accounts of conscious experience. This approach, however, does not consider the modular configurations (and reconfigurations) that constitute these whole-brain states, and that have been linked to cognition (Bassett et al, PNAS, 2011; Braun et al, PNAS, 2015). We quantified these modular dynamics during wakeful rest and anaesthesia-induced unconsciousness, using resting state fMRI with the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus; Hori et al, Cereb Cortex, 2020). We found that the awake condition was characterised by more coordinated reconfiguration of a smaller number of modules, and by greater stability among whole-brain networks derived from these modules. Conversely, the anaesthetised condition was characterised by the more haphazard reconfiguration of a larger number of modules and a decrease in network integrity. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that unconsciousness results from the fragmentation of whole-brain networks, and that the coordinated reconfiguration of modular structure is a marker of cognitive engagement in the conscious state.",Dominic Standage,Yuki Hori; Ravi S.

rec1NltyP6yBAMTev,Investigating Intero- and Exteroceptive Predictive Processes in Major Depressive Disorder,"The association between depression and derangement of sensory processing is well known.  However, our understanding of the neural processes underlying sensory perception, both intero- and exteroception, is undergoing a rapid change. Predictive coding, for example, is a theoretical framework that proposes that the brain constantly generates hypotheses that predict sensory input at varying levels of abstraction and minimizes prediction errors either by updating its prior hypotheses (perceptual inference) or by modifying sensory input through action (active inference). In other words, (i) both bottom up and top down information flow among hierarchical cortical regions play important role in sensory processing and (ii) sensory and motor processes are highly entangled. In the current study, we investigate whether and how depression alters top-down and bottom-up information flow in the sensory (and motor) cortex. We implement effective connectivity analysis among the brain regions involved in intero- and exteroception as well as motor processing employing Dynamic Causal Modelling on resting state fMRI data from 62 individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 62 age and sex matched healthy controls. We find alteration in effective connectivity in MDD patients in areas involved in exteroception and motor processing (e.g., V1→FP1, MC→V1, VLPFC→SMA, SMA→V1) but not in areas involved in interoception.

rec1Q9QLnUtTT7xVe,Dopaminergic activation of prefrontal astrocytes requires both dopamine and adrenergic receptors,"Cortical dopamine is crucial in many facets of behavior, including acute stress, depression and schizophrenia. Dopamine research has almost exclusively focused on neuronal signaling. However, astrocytes—which are organized in networks that tile the brain and express G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for most neurotransmitters—are also well positioned to listen to and respond to dopamine signals. Here, we investigated the astrocytic response to dopamine in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the main cortical recipient of dopaminergic inputs. First, using transgenic reporter lines, we found that prefrontal astrocytes in rodent PFC express both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. Next, we expressed fluorescent reporters for GPCR second messengers in mouse prefrontal cortical slices. While inactivating neurons to isolate astrocyte-specific responses, we found that activation of dopamine receptors in astrocytes does not engage the canonical cyclic AMP signaling pathway downstream of dopamine receptors. In contrast, dopamine mobilized astrocytic calcium in both astrocyte somata and processes. To test which receptors mediate this calcium response, we used bath application of pharmacology, as well as one-photon uncaging of dopamine. These experiments revealed that dopamine recruits prefrontal astrocytes within seconds, and that antagonizing dopamine receptors only partially dampened the response of prefrontal astrocytes to dopamine, whereas the response was fully prevented by blocking adrenergic receptors. Lastly, we implanted GRIN lenses to image calcium dynamics in PFC astrocytes in vivo for the first time, and find that they exhibit different properties relative to locomotion than astrocytes in primary sensory cortices. Our finding that fast dopamine activation of prefrontal astrocytes requires both dopamine and adrenergic receptors is potentially relevant in the treatment of disorders such as schizophrenia and depression, where manipulation of more than one monoaminergic system is more beneficial than monotherapy. Together, our results suggest that astrocytes are important circuit components for dopamine signaling in PFC circuits.",Silvia Pittolo,"Sae Yokoyama, Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco; Michael Reitman, Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco; Kira Poskanzer, Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco & Kavli Institute for Fundamental Neuroscience","University of California, San Francisco (grid.266102.1)","Theme B: Neural Excitability, Synapses, and Glia",Traditional talk,2020-10-26 22:00:00+00:00,2020-10-26 22:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/vJj-19c353c
rec1VQxgZRSz4MTyk,Central neural circuits supporting olfactory navigation in walking Drosophila,"All organisms must navigate to find food and resources. For many organisms this requires navigating in a turbulent chemical environment, where odour cues alone are insufficient to locate food sources. A commonly used algorithm in such environments is to surge upwind during odour, and cast crosswind at odour offset. Critically, this algorithm depends on the integration of odour information with wind direction cues. Previously, our lab developed a high-throughput behavioural paradigm for walking Drosophila, where an attractive odour elicits two motor programs: an upwind run during odour, and search behaviour at odour offset. Here, we used this paradigm to identify central circuits that translate sensory stimuli into navigation behaviours.

To identify neurons involved in olfactory motor program generation, we took an optogenetic approach. Beginning at the olfactory periphery, we first showed that activation of orco+ olfactory receptor neurons produces both upwind runs and offset search. We next activated output neurons in higher order olfactory areas, the lateral horn and mushroom body (LHONs and MBONs), and found subsets of these also produce the complete olfactory navigation motor program of upwind runs and offset search. Using 2-photon imaging and a 5 direction wind-odour manifold, we found these LHONs and MBONs encode odour in a non-directional manner, indicating that odour and wind direction signals must be integrated downstream.

To identify downstream targets of navigation-promoting LHONs and MBONs, we used trans-synaptic tracing. We found that downstream neurons targeted the fan-shaped body (FSB), a region implicated in navigation. We performed an activation screen of the FSB and identified both input neurons and local/output neurons that generate upwind navigation when activated. Several groups of input neurons responded to odour in a non-directional manner, while at least one group of local neurons showed some direction-selective odour responses.  Connectomic analysis suggests these local neuron receive input both from olfactory FSB inputs and from wind-direction selective ventral P-FNs (Currier et al. 2020). Local FSB neurons may represent a site where appetitive odour and wind direction information are integrated to drive navigation behaviours.

rec1ZyNo6G3eWt72w,Pannexin1 Knockout Zebrafish as a Model for Seizure Investigation ,"Many epileptic patients with recurrent seizures do not respond to medical interventions available on the market today. Evidence suggests that Pannexin1, an ATP-release membrane channel, plays a vital role in modifying neuronal excitability by altering the electrical and metabolic balances of the neural network.    
Our research aims at evaluating whether Pannexin1 is a target for therapeutic intervention in epilepsy. A Pannexin1 knock-out zebrafish model was established to investigate the role of Pannexin1 in a seizure model in vivo. Additionally, we have employed probenecid, a known Pannexin1 channel blocker, to assess for the efficacy of pharmacological targeting. The resistance of the zebrafish to chemically induced seizures was investigated via their behavioural locomotor response, signs of stress on a molecular level, and in vivo electrophysiological recordings from the brain. 
Our findings demonstrate that Pannexin1 channels contribute to the distortion of the electrochemical balance and aid in the propagation of seizures in vivo. Lack of Pannexin1, or pharmacological block of the channels, resulted in decreased seizure-related behaviour and electrophysiological ictal-like events, improved survival and reduced molecular stress responses. 
Zebrafish are an appealing and multifaceted animal model for pre-clinical epilepsy studies; as they allow for high-throughput behavioural phenotyping and the examination of intact neuronal circuits. In future work we aim to incorporate Machine Learning in the analysis of zebrafish behaviour, thus automating the procedure, and unravelling novel patterns in phenotypic data.

rec1a8T3N55YvwtIK,Predictive visual motion extrapolation emerges spontaneously and without supervision from a layered neural network with spike-timing-dependent plasticity,"The fact that the transmission and processing of visual information in the brain takes time presents a problem for the accurate real-time localisation of a moving object. One way this problem might be solved is extrapolation: using an object’s past trajectory to predict its location in the present moment. Here, we investigate how a simulated in silico layered neural network might implement such extrapolation mechanisms, and how the necessary neural circuits might develop. We allowed an unsupervised hierarchical network of velocity-tuned neurons to learn its connectivity through spike-timing dependent plasticity. We show that the temporal contingencies between the different neural populations that are activated by an object as it moves causes the receptive fields of higher-level neurons to shift in the direction opposite to their preferred direction of motion. The result is that neural populations spontaneously start to represent moving objects as being further along their trajectory than where they were physically detected. Due to the inherent delays of neural transmission, this effectively compensates for (part of) those delays by bringing the represented position of a moving object closer to its instantaneous position in the world. Finally, we show that this model accurately predicts the pattern of perceptual mislocalisation that arises when human observers are required to localise a moving object relative to a flashed static object (the flash-lag effect).

In this study, the effects of FTY720 and sodium valproate (VPA) as histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDAC) on the conductivity of visual signals, extent of demyelination area, glial activation, and expression levels of HDAC1and S1PR1 have been evaluated in the optic chiasm of lysolecithin (LPC)-induced demyelination model. In order to produce this demyelination model, LPC (1%, 2 μL) was injected into the rat optic chiasm. Latency of visual waves was measured by visual evoked potential (VEP) recording. The extent of demyelination area and level of glial activation were assessed using immunostaining. Gene expression analysis was performed to evaluate the expression levels of HDAC1, S1PR1, Olig2, and MBP in the optic chiasm. Analysis of electrophysiological data showed that LPC administration increased the latency of visual signals. FTY720 improved the functional recovery of the visual pathway and reduced the level of glial activation in the optic chiasm. FTY720 enhanced myelin repair and up-regulated the expression levels of Olig2 and MBP. Additionally, the expression levels of HDAC1 and S1PR1 were significantly reduced in animals treated with FTY720. In contrast to FTY720 treated animals, administration of VPA could not significantly improve the functional recovery of optic pathway following LPC injection. Cumulatively, the results of the present study demonstrate that FTY720 application improves the functional recovery of the optic pathway by reducing demyelination levels, amelioration of glial activation, and down-regulating of S1PR1 and HDAC1.",mona hashemian,"Maryam Ghasemi-Kasman, Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran ; Hadi Parsian, Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran ; Farzin Sadeghi, Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran",Babol University of Medical Sciences (grid.411495.c),"Theme A: Development, Neurodegenerative Disorders and Injury",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 10:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 10:15:00+00:00,
rec1ctiSAgIv4dHQj,Melanopsin-mediated regulation of pupil size in natural vision,"In humans, steady-state pupil size is largely determined by the activity of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the short-wavelength-sensitive photopigment melanopsin (λmax = 480 nm). From well-controlled laboratory studies employing parametric stimuli, we know that radiance drives the size of the pupil, with higher melanopic radiance associated with smaller pupil size, but at present there is no established data set for variations in pupil size in real-world light exposure. Here, we demonstrate a novel method to assess the light input regulating steady-state pupil size under dynamic, real-world conditions. We integrated a wearable infrared video-based eye tracker (Pupil Labs GmbH) with a small-scale spectroradiometer (Ocean Insight Inc.). Both devices were attached to a bespoke 3D-printed adjustable head mount and connected to a miniature, battery-driven control computer (Raspberry Pi), enabling simultaneous sampling of pupil size and spectral irradiance at 10-sec intervals. We measured natural variation in pupil size across two protocols, in which healthy, young participants (n=7; age: 20-30 years) moved in and between indoor and outdoor environments varying in light conditions and engaged in a range of everyday tasks. We successfully measured variation in pupil size as a function of near-corneal melanopic irradiance in the real world, yielding distinct dose-response curves for each participant. Under these uncontrolled conditions, data retention was reasonably high (~65% data retained; total number of usable spectrum and pupil size pairs: 6620). In line with the sluggish properties of melanopsin signalling, pupil size was more accurately predicted by integrating preceding melanopic irradiance values (60-sec window) than the simultaneous samples. In summary, we demonstrate a robust paradigm for conducting ambulatory research measuring melanopsin-mediated physiological signals in humans outside of the laboratory.",Rafael Lazar,Dr Manuel Spitschan,Universitäre Psychiatrische Kliniken Basel (grid.412556.1),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 12:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 12:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/sv38AYI0-DY
rec1g78EuNtcCsjIA,Predictive integration of landmarks for future gaze commands in monkey frontal cortex,"The brain is essentially a predictive machine and constantly generates internal models from the environmental inputs that keep us prepared for future action. How does the brain use visual landmarks for future gaze commands and what are the neural underpinnings thereof? Recently, we showed that the brain detects sudden landmark shifts in the neural activity of two important gaze areas: the frontal (FEF) and supplementary eye field (SEF, and also involved in prediction and higher cognitive control) (Bharmauria et al. 2020a,b). Here, we simulataneously recorded spatially tuned neurons from the FEF (n = 147) and SEF (n = 68) of two monkeys (Macaca mullata) trained on a cue-conflict memory gaze task where they could use quasi-predictable (fixed amplitude, variable direction) masked landmark shifts for future gaze command. There was a 30 % influence of the landmark shift on gaze and it caused the gaze endpoints to deviate in a ‘donut-like’ pattern around the original target. We then fit neural response fields (RFs) against a target-to-gaze (T-G) continuum in eye-coordinates and tracked their evolution in the spatiotemporal domain (from visual response onset until the mask-off/landmark-on). A sudden predictive shift (before mask-on) toward gaze was noticed in the SEF but not the FEF responses. Collectively, these results along with our previous findings (Bharmauria et al. 2020a,b) suggest that in the gaze system the SEF provides control signals to the FEF for the final gaze command. First, the SEF detects the quasi-predictive information in its neural activity and then relays it to the FEF for incorporating the final gaze command through closely knit visual-visuomotor-motor circuitries between both areas with opposing roles.

rec1lBPMiFYMwuWm9,The more the merrier: Investigation of the perception of nature inspired stimuli via in vivo 2Photon imaging and visual discrimination tasks.,"Contrary to bandwidth enriched naturalistic stimuli, standard simplistic visual stimuli such as sine-wave gratings are parametrically defined and lack variability. In view of highly developed visual systems, i.e., the primate visual system, it has been proposed that due to a divisive gain normalization, more information in a stimulus does not necessarily come with a functional advantage in terms of perception. This study aims to test the validity of this concept in mice in respect to their capability to discriminate between orientations and spatial frequencies with varying bandwidths. In a touchscreen chamber-based 2AFC task, two paradigms test for respectively spatial frequency discrimination performance with varying orientation bandwidths and the effect of different spatial frequency bandwidths on orientation discrimination. There was no clear significant influence of the spatial frequency bandwidth on orientation discrimination, whereas spatial frequency discrimination was significantly influenced by the orientation bandwidth. We can conclude that the proposed gain normalization seems to take place in terms of an orientation discrimination task, but not for a spatial frequency discrimination task. In order to address this question at the level of a large population of individual neurons, we used in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging in virally injected mice (pAAV.Syn.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40), expressing the activity dependent calcium indicator GCamP6f. Orientation and spatial frequency bandwidth enriched stimuli were presented at pseudo-random sequences. Significantly higher qualitative and quantitative responses resulted from the higher orientation bandwidths, whereas the same effect was not observed with the spatial frequency bandwidth increase.

We hypothesize that the perfect accumulator assumption might explain the integration of the facial information. Having developed a customized algorithm, neutral faces have been geometrically morphed together such that -100 represents prototype one, +100 prototype two and zero the middle face between the two faces. The trials are designed in a way that stimuli either have three informative features (eyes, mouth, nose simultaneously) or only one informative feature (eyes, mouth, nose individually) fluctuating in time and combined with a mask throughout the trial. Eight human subjects (four women) participate in this face discrimination task after getting familiar with the pure faces with no mask and passing the train phase. The participants invited to the main phase of the experiment are instructed to maintain their gaze on the red fixation point in the center of the screen and report if the stimuli displayed on the left side of the fixation point is more similar to the first prototype or the second one. Using the logistic regression model on the probability of correct in different morph levels, it reveals that the subjects are not biased toward any of the choices. Having calculated the evidence contained in each one-informative feature trials and using the perfect accumulator assumption, we compute the expected accuracy for combining the evidence from one-informative feature trials. We show that expected accuracy calculated from the combination of one-informative feature trials are significantly smaller than the accuracy gained from the three informative features trials. Rejecting the initial hypothesis, the finding suggests that the integration of facial feature information can be more than the sum of individual information of each informative feature.",hadiseh hajimohammadi,"Reza Ebrahimpour, Cognitive Science Research lab., Department of Computer Engineering, Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University, Tehran, Iran; Sajjad Zabbah, School of Cognitive Sciences, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Tehran, Iran",Institute for Cognitive Science Studies (grid.482821.5),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-29 09:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 09:15:00+00:00,
rec1o6ZxIrRg42T9v,Travel Direction as a Fundamental Component of Human Navigation,"In daily life, one’s travel direction is typically correlated with head direction, but from first principles, these two factors can offer different spatial information. Although head direction has been found to be a crucial part of human navigation, it is unclear whether travel direction plays a primary role in navigation. To test this, we adopted a visual motion adaptation paradigm, which allowed probes for selectivity of travel direction. To do so, we first adapted people to visual self-motion in one direction in a virtual hallway, and then tested people during a series of visual back and forth movements, toward and away, from the initial travel direction. In both phases, the head direction was reversed occasionally to be dissociated from the travel direction, precluding optic flow from contributing to any observed adaptation effects. We then asked subjects to report their net travel direction, measuring psychometric functions for perceived travel direction, under conditions of adaptation and no-adaptation. We found high-level motion aftereffects of travel direction, suggesting that travel direction is a fundamental component of human navigation. Interestingly, subjects had a higher frequency of reporting net travel toward the adapted direction, indicating that the aftereffect is opposite to the traditional motion aftereffect. The same aftereffect was found after controlling for response biases. We propose that the travel direction system is composed of separate sensory inputs and feed-forward high-level motion processing pathways, which may overlap or interact with the head direction system.

rec1sT6Ea2CONTV5k,Understanding muscarinic-mediated signaling in astrocytes using DREADDs for the control of neuroinflammation and cognition,"In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the loss of cholinergic neurons appears to drive degeneration in affected brain areas. Increasing evidence reinforces a strong relationship between cholinergic failure, neurodegeneration, and cognitive deficits in AD. With aging, glial cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to age-related neurodegeneration and deficits in brain function. Astrocytes play important roles in cognition and modulation of neuroinflammation, but their role in AD remains unknown. Recent observations suggest that cholinergic signaling, via acetylcholine, regulates cognitive processing and hippocampal function, partially by signaling in astrocytes. Signaling via the Gq protein-coupled M3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3Gq), known to elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentration, to astrocytes can trigger the release of glial modulators favoring hippocampal plasticity. Conversely, Gi protein-coupled M4-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M4Gi) signaling in astrocytes impairs remote memory recall and decreases brain activity. We hypothesize that activating muscarinic receptors modulates astrocyte activity and leads to changes in neuroinflammation and cognition. Our objectives are to determine whether we can modulate muscarinic G-protein signaling specifically in astrocytes, to determine the baseline effect of astrocyte muscarinic signaling activation on behavior and cytokine expression and to determine if this signaling plays a role in AD. We generated mice expressing either Gq(hM3Dq) or Gi(hM4Di) Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). These DREADDs are mutated receptors that longer respond to their endogenous ligand acetylcholine but are instead activated by Clozapine N-Oxide (CNO). We have confirmed that in both hM3Dq and hM4Di mice, DREADDs are expressed specifically in astrocytes. Activation of hM3Dq in cultured primary astrocytes, by CNO, increased intracellular Ca2+. Activation of global astrocyte Gi or Gq receptors do not show significant changes in motor activity or anxiety-like behavior. Future experiments will observe cognitive function tasks using touchscreen technology with acute and chronic activation of hM3Dq or hM4Di receptors and determine whether this signaling can regulate neuroinflammation.

rec1thjvnlXpqjMBD,Medial prefrontal activity at encoding determines the recognition advantage of threatening faces after 1.5 years,"Previous studies demonstrated that faces with emotional expressions are better remembered than neutral faces. However, whether the memory advantage of emotional faces persists over years and which neural systems may mediate such an effect remains unknown. The present study investigated recognition of incidentally encoded faces with angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral expressions over a retention interval of >1.5 years (N = 102). Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that, following the long retention interval, faces with threatening expressions (i.e. angry and fearful) were significantly better recognized than happy and neutral faces. Comparison with immediate recognition performance indicated that this effect was driven by decreased recognition of non-threatening faces over the retention interval. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data was acquired during encoding and results revealed that differential neural reactivity to faces with different expressions in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex/medial orbitofrontal cortex (vmPFC/mOFC) neurally mediated the long-term recognition advantage for threatening faces. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that threatening facial expressions during initial encounters lead to persistent face recognition over periods of at least 1.5 years, and that encoding-related activity in the medial prefrontal cortex may underlie the preserved recognition. The findings have implications for understanding emotional memory formation in interpersonal contexts and have implications for affective disorders characterized by dysregulations in interpersonal and emotional memory domains.

rec206ypayaLBYVFX,Chronic imaging of local populations in auditory cortex reveals ongoing recombination of neuronal ensembles representing sensory stimuli,"Neuronal ensembles are believed to form essential functional units within neural networks. How structurally and functionally stable are such ensembles? This question is of particular interest in light of evidence that synaptic connections show substantial remodeling on the time scale of days. At the same time, the perception of external stimuli has to be highly reliable, while allowing for flexible integration of novel experiences to form associations to already known stimuli.
Using chronic imaging of local population activity in mouse auditory cortex, we show that neuronal responses to short sounds typically cluster into a near discrete set of response modes. Moreover, we find that response modes show significant remodeling over several days. We identify a set of elementary operations capturing the dynamics of sensory representations, which involve changes in the set of stimuli driving particular response modes as well as their formation and elimination.
We demonstrate that stable encoding of external stimuli is maintained in activity patterns of local populations despite ongoing remodeling of sensory representations. Training a decoder based on logistic regression using information on a single time point either from single cell activity or from response mode patterns, respectively, is sufficient to decode stimulus identity over long time scales. Auditory fear conditioning introduces biases in the frequency of specific operations mediating increased associations of sensory stimuli and improved sound encoding.

While these two modalities have distinct advantages and disadvantages, neither provides complete, unbiased information about the underlying neural population. Here, we compare evoked responses in visual cortex recorded in awake mice under highly standardized conditions using either imaging or electrophysiology. Across all stimulus conditions tested, we observe a larger fraction of responsive neurons in electrophysiology and higher stimulus selectivity in calcium imaging. This work explores which data transformations are most useful for explaining these modality-specific discrepancies. We show that the higher selectivity in imaging can be partially reconciled by applying a spikes-to-calcium forward model to the electrophysiology data. However, the forward model could not reconcile differences in responsiveness without sub-selecting neurons based on event rate or level of signal contamination. This suggests that differences in responsiveness more likely reflect neuronal sampling bias or cluster-merging artifacts during spike sorting of electrophysiological recordings, rather than flaws in event detection from fluorescence time series.

Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated how this expertise alters brain activity by comparing objects of expertise with other objects (e.g., Gauthier et al., 2000, Nature Neuroscience; Harel et al., 2010, Cerebral Cortex). However, everyone knows whether an image depicts a bird or a car. In contrast, only a bird expert can tell apart a great-tailed from a boat-tailed grackle. Here we focus upon the neural basis of expertise at this detailed level by comparing the similarities and differences of the representational spaces of birds between 20 ornithologists and 20 control participants. We scanned subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging while presenting images of 24 different bird types. The image set was organized in 8 triplets, which each contained two birds that belonged to the same species but were visually different (e.g. male and female) and one bird that resembled one of the other two birds but belonged to a different species. As such, the triplets dissociated species-level semantics from visual similarity. Behaviorally, ornithologists showed more within-group consistency in subjective similarity ratings compared to controls. In addition, the ornithologists showed a sensitivity to the dissociation between species and visual appearance when rating semantic similarity. A neural representational similarity analysis analyzed the multi-voxel patterns in low-level visual cortex (LVC), high-level visual cortex (HVC), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). In PFC, the neural patterns distinguished bird types more reliably in ornithologists than in controls. In addition, the similarity structure of the neural patterns was more shared between ornithologists than between controls, in particular in HVC and in PFC, and more correlated with behavioral similarity. These high-level behavioral and neural representations were also correlated with the representational spaces in deep artificial neural networks.

rec2FQimwQOLszzYo,Towards Machine to Brain Interfaces: Sensory Stimulation Enhances Sensorimotor Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Upper Limb Amputees,"Recent development of sensory stimulation techniques demonstrates the ability to elicit touch-like phantom sensations in upper limb amputees. The cortical processing of this phantom sensation and the corresponding influences on sensorimotor functional connectivity have not been studied. We show the temporal dynamics of brain functional connectivity with and without sensory stimulation. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 2 amputee participants and 3 able-bodied participants while they were performing hand movements with and without transcutaneous nerve stimulation. We applied dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis, by modeling cortical signals as a series of functional networks along the temporal dimension. Results show that sensory stimulation enhances the speed of information transfer and number of connection paths between brain systems such as primary somatosensory (S1), primary motor, and higher order processing regions, all of which are involved in sensorimotor processing. The increased number in connection paths between S1 and motor systems is the most significant during the first 750 ms of the entire stimulation period. This is the first work to reveal dynamic communication between somatosensory, motor, and higher order processing regions in the cortex of amputees in response to sensory stimulation. This work provides insights into how multiple sensory modalities contribute to the motor cortex to generate motor actions. Topics for future research include investigating the functional connections from motor or multisensory processing systems to the somatosensory system in similar tasks, exploring the modular changes of large scale brain networks, and mapping the long term brain changes in amputee participants from immediate loss of sensory input to restoration through sensory feedback.",Keqin Ding,"Keqin Ding, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Andrei Dragomir, National University of Singapore; Rohit Bose, University of Pittsburgh; Luke E.

rec2KWsuj8t1tXE4E,"Influence of ageing and chronic stroke on postural control, muscle-tendon mechanics, and soleus muscle responses to proprioceptive stimuli during standing","Proprioceptive sensory information from the lower limbs plays a critical role in the control of posture and balance, and changes in proprioceptive pathways with healthy ageing and following a stroke may contribute to impaired balance and falls. Here, we aimed to examine how healthy ageing and chronic stroke influence the frequency characteristics of the soleus muscle response to proprioceptive stimuli during standing. We also aimed to examine whether there are relationships between soleus responses, postural control, and muscle-tendon mechanics. We applied a continuous noisy vibration to the right or left Achilles tendon and examined responses in soleus surface EMG in a sample of 54 healthy adults across a broad age range (20–54 years) and 8 adults with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Our results showed the soleus response frequency bandwidth became progressively narrower with age, and soleus response gain was lower in older relative to young adults across a bandwidth of ~28–54 Hz. Across the age range, the amplitude of the soleus response was negatively correlated with age. We found minimal age-related differences in mechanical admittance of the muscle-tendon unit, suggesting this did not mediate the changes in soleus responses. Participants with chronic stroke had lower anteroposterior centre of pressure amplitude and frequency on the affected side, which suggests they relied more upon the less-affected limb for balance control. In addition, participants who showed an asymmetry in soleus responses characterized by larger responses on the affected side tended to have lower mechanical admittance at frequencies beyond ~20 Hz, as well as poorer motor recovery assessed with the Fugle-Meyer scale. The age-related changes in soleus responses to proprioceptive stimuli reflect progressive changes in muscle spindle morphology and stretch sensitivity, meanwhile, changes post-stroke may be related to altered muscle-tendon mechanics and postural control strategies.",Robyn Mildren,"Mildren RL, Johns Hopkins University; Pollock CL, University of British Columbia; Lim SB, University of British Columbia; Schmidt ME, University of British Columbia; Eschelmuller G, University of British Columbia; Carpenter MG, University of British Columbia; Blouin J-S, University of British Columbia; Inglis J.T., University of British Columbia",Johns Hopkins University (grid.21107.35),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-29 21:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 21:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/6GFFTjSKIgM
rec2PZiCtxPYx5xl8,Characterization and analysis of visual processing in humans using fMRI data and machine learning techniques,"Recent studies suggest that shape and surface characteristics of objects appear to be encoded in the ventral visual cortex. With this idea, this work aims to get insights into the human visual system from the analysis of the public experimental database VIM-1. The dataset consists of displaying images to subjects, with neuronal activity being measured using fMRI. In order to find clusters inherent to the responses to visual stimuli, we use the k-means algorithm. We could (i) find groups of voxels that have similar brain activity, also cohesive in anatomy; (ii) obtain groups of images that provide similar brain activations. Anatomical group locations are related to the locations of the main visual information processing pathways in the brain, the ventral and dorsal pathways. Finally, using the Mann-Whitney U test, we found a statistically significant difference between the density of the image edges and the level of neuronal activity in groups of images with opposite activations. Additionally, from the F test (ANOVA), we found a correlation between the edge density and the activation level in a cluster, which comprises most of the V1 area.

rec2Uy68omGUMwy1X,Pathfinder: open source software for analyzing spatial navigation search strategies,"Spatial navigation is a universal behavior that varies depending on goals, experience and available sensory stimuli. Spatial navigational tasks are routinely used to study learning, memory and goal-directed behavior, in both animals and humans. One popular paradigm for testing spatial memory is the Morris water maze. Researchers typically express learning as a function of the latency to escape, though this reveals little about the underlying navigational strategies. Recently, a number of studies have begun to classify water maze search strategies in order to clarify the precise spatial and mnemonic functions of different brain regions. However, despite their usefulness, strategy analyses have not been widely adopted due to the lack of software to automate analyses. We developed Pathfinder, an open source application for analyzing spatial navigation behaviour. Here we show Pathfinder’s performance on a sample dataset, where it effectively characterized highly-specific spatial search strategies used during the trials. Our software provides support for inputs from commonly-used, commercially-available and open-source software packages, is optimized for classifying search strategies, and can also be expanded easily to work with other species and spatial navigation tasks. Pathfinder has the ability to automatically determine the platform location as well as the size of the pool and related pool parameters.  It can generate heatmaps of trials, analyze navigation with respect to multiple goal locations, and can be easily updated to accommodate future developments in spatial navigation behaviours.",Matthew Cooke,"Matthew B.

rec2a3qjQxQtu1mnV,Volumetric analysis reveals bilateral cerebellar atrophy in Rasmussen encephalitis,"Background: Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) is a rare autoimmune disease affecting one single cerebral hemisphere, leading to neuroinflammation, epileptic seizures and, finally, atrophy.
Besides primary atrophy localized within the ipsilesional cerebral hemisphere, recent studies have uncovered volumetric changes occurring within the contralesional hemisphere, which are conceptualized as secondary changes. Primary and secondary changes show a striking inhomogeneous distribution and severity pattern among patients, raising questions about the underlying mechanisms.  

Aims: This study aims to uncover atrophic changes being present within the cerebellum of RE patients and sets them in relation to atrophy patterns of the cerebral cortex.

Methods: In a cross-sectional manner 57 patients (37 female, mean age=22+/-16y) diagnosed with RE were tested against 57 matched healthy controls. Using a surface-based approach morphometric measures of the cerebral cortex were examined. Depending on the visual appearance of cerebral atrophy, hypothetical groups of predominantly affected regions were formed. Cerebellar atrophy was studied by performing a Voxel-based-Morphometry and related to the groups of different regional cerebral affection.

Results: The cerebral cortex of the ipsilesional hemisphere showed widespread atrophy, particularly located around the sylvian fissure (fwe-corrp<0.01). The VBM of the cerebellum revealed bihemispheric atrophy most pronounced in both cerebellar tonsils and the contralesional posterior lobe (tfce-corrp<0.01). While significant atrophy was observed in patients with occipital, temporal and insular cerebral atrophy focus, patients with a frontal disease focus or a diffuse atrophy distribution did not show significant cerebellar atrophy compared to controls. 

Conclusion: Supporting previous studies, atrophy within the ipsilesional cerebral hemisphere showed a transsylvian predilection site. Surprisingly, both cerebellar hemispheres showed significant atrophy, even though the primary pathology is thought to be restricted to one cerebral hemisphere. Crossed cerebellar atrophy might explain degeneration observed on the contralesional cerebellar hemisphere, while excitotoxicity, antiepileptic drugs or even the primary disease might be causes for bilateral neuronal degeneration.

rec2bdbHctI9Yps2O,"Posner cueing specifically modulates attention, but not expectation: Behavioral and neural evidence","Attention and expectation are cognitive processes that help us navigate our environment efficiently. Each can modulate observers’ perceptual sensitivity (d’), decisional criteria (c), or both. Standard “attention” tasks involving probabilistic attention cues (e.g Posner cueing task), are hypothesized to conflate the effects of these two processes on behavior. 

We tested this hypothesis by having the same set of n=19 subjects perform two tasks: a standard Posner cueing task (two-alternative detection/2-ADC task) and a two-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) task. We replicated a previous study (Wyart et al, PNAS, 2012, DOI:10.1073/pnas.1120118109) in which subjects performed an detection 2-AFC task with independent probability (expectation) and relevance (attention) cues. Our task overcame key limitations of this previous study, and confirmed that signal probability modulated criteria alone whereas relevance modulated d’ alone. 

Next, the same subjects who performed the 2-AFC task also performed a 2-ADC (Posner cueing) task with spatial probabilistic cues. Subjects were cued to the most probable location of an upcoming target event (change in orientation) and indicated whether they perceived the change at the cued location, at the uncued location, or not at all. In this task, probabilistic cueing modulated both d’ and criteria. 

Nevertheless, only d’ modulations (difference in d’ between cued and uncued locations) were correlated across subjects between the 2-ADC and 2-AFC tasks (r=0.63, p<0.01, n=19 subjects) whereas criterion modulations were uncorrelated (r=-0.13, p=0.56). In addition, relevance cues (but not probability cues) in the 2-AFC task, and Posner cues in the 2-ADC task systematically modulated the power of EEG steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and alpha-band oscillations. 

Our results provide direct behavioral and neural evidence indicating that probabilistic cues, such as Posner cues, serve as attention, rather than expectation, cues.",Sricharan Sunder (he/him),"Kavya Rajendran, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore; Devarajan Sridharan, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore",Indian Institute of Science Bangalore (grid.34980.36),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 16:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 16:15:00+00:00,
rec2ltn2XcTmnMzGu,Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) increases social behaviour and bursting activity in medial prefrontal cortex neurons.,"Social behaviour (SB) encompasses a plethora of complex interactions among individuals. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) exerts a pivotal role in the modulation of SB in mammals since mPFC dysregulation has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of impaired SB phenotypes. In the past 15 years, psychedelic drugs have been investigated as potential therapeutics in psychiatry. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in humans has been shown, in clinical settings, to produce feelings of happiness, trust, closeness to others, and enhanced emotional empathy. Despite these positive results, the ability of LSD to modulate SB has not been investigated, and the neuronal mechanisms underlying LSD's behavioural effects remain elusive. Here, we dissected the ability of acute and repeated LSD to exert prosocial effects and to modulate neuronal activity of the mPFC in mice. We found that repeated (30ug/kg per day, for 7 days), but not acute LSD treatment significantly increased the time spent interacting with an intruder mouse in the Direct Social Interaction Test. Similarly, repeated LSD treatment increased sociability and the preference for social novelty in mice subjected to the Three-Chambers Sociability Test. These behavioural results are paralleled with our electrophysiological findings. Using in-vivo extracellular single-unit recordings, we found that acute LSD treatment had no significant effect on the spontaneous firing nor the bursting activity of mPFC neurons, but repeated LSD treatment significantly increased the bursting activity of these neurons. Ultimately, our results demonstrate the ability of LSD to produce pro-social effects that are coupled with an increase in mPFC neuronal bursting activity.",Athanasios Markopoulos (he/him),"Dr. Antonio Inserra, McGill University; Dr. Danilo De Gregorio, McGill University; Prof. Gabriella Gobbi, McGill University.",McGill University (grid.14709.3b),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 17:00:00+00:00,2020-10-30 17:15:00+00:00,
rec2oMQZNvu1gJqEA,A new non-Hominid primate network highlights the singularity of the human default mode network,"The human default mode network (DMN) is particularly involved in high cognitive abilities such as self-directed thoughts. In humans, one of the typical functional features of this network includes a strong correlated activity between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Although these connections are generally assumed to be present in other primates, recent studies highlight poor connection between these two regions in marmosets but strong correlations between PCC and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; 8Ad). This disparity of the DMN connectivity has not yet been studied in other primates and no comparison was directly made with human data. Here, we aim to determine whether the humans DMN carries a connectivity pattern that distinguishes it from other primates. Moreover, we aim to identify the non-hominid primate network in which the mPFC is involved at rest. 
In the current study, we compared the resting-state network functional organisation in humans, macaques, and mouse lemurs. We discovered a network involving mPFC that was highly similar in both non-hominid primates but was not identified in humans. We also detected a non-hominid primate “DMN-like” dissimilar to that of humans that did not involve mPFC but dlPFC regions such as 8Ad. We created a functional atlas for each species and compared the fingerprint pattern and connectivity magnitude between various clusters of interest. We found strong correlation between PCC and mPFC in humans but not in mouse lemurs and macaques. These findings diverge from the current literature that propose strong similarities between primates and human’s DMN. Altogether, our results suggest that high order networks in non-hominid primates display closer characteristics between themselves than to humans. These findings suggest that important events may have occurred during the hominid evolution. We propose that a reorganization/fusion of the fronto-temporal/parietal network is an element of the singularity of the human DMN.",Clément Garin,"Clément M.Garin, Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157; Christopher T.

rec2p7vL4zVXFHgk9,Sleep does not facilitate human fear memory consolidation,"Introduction
The positive effects of sleep on the consolidation of declarative memories are generally well known. The role of sleep in consolidation of fear memories has not received as much attention. Moreover, only a few studies in humans have used physiological indices of conditioning, and none used central physiological measures. In the current study we investigated how sleep affects (1) consolidation of fear memories on behavioral level and (2) central measures of fear conditioned response by means of EEG.
Methods
In our experiment event-related brain potentials (ERP) were recorded during a fear conditioning procedure presented twice, before and after sleep or control intervention in 18 healthy young individuals. The procedure involved pairing of a neutral tone (CS+) with a highly unpleasant sound (UCS+). As a control, another neutral tone (CS-) was paired with a neutral (for some subjects slightly pleasant) sound (UCS-). The two sessions of conditioning were separated by approximately 2.5 hours when: on one experimental day subjects watched a silent movie for 2h (wake intervention); on another day the participants had 2h sleep opportunity (sleep intervention). The two days were separated by at least two weeks and counterbalanced in respect to the stimulus mapping. 
Results
In EEG differential conditioning manifested itself in the contingent negative variance (CNV)-like slow ERP component. Both period of sleep and wakefulness resulted in increased amplitude of the CNV to CS+ (main effect of contingency F(1,17) = 17.6, p < 0.001) without a significant difference between the type of intervention. The same effect was obtained on the behavioral level, with Valence ratings of CS+ were more negative as compared to CS- (F(1,17) = 14.9, p < 0.001). The intervention (sleep/wake) followed by a block of extinction learning. Relearning of fear after the extinction elicited stronger differential response in CNV (main effect of Time (before-after comparison) F(1,17) = 6.5, p = .02) but not in the behavioral ratings (F(1,17) = 0.66, p = .426).
Conclusions
The data indicate that fear memories are consolidated with the course of time with no beneficial effect of sleep or a period of wakefulness.

rec32Bb5WhT1DFdOB,Motor cortical control of vocal behavior in neotropical singing mice,"Using sounds for social interactions is common across many taxa. Humans engaged in conversation, for example, take rapid turns to go back and forth. This ability to act upon sensory information to generate a desired motor output is a fundamental feature of animal behavior. How the brain enables such flexible sensorimotor transformations, for example during vocal interactions, is a central question in neuroscience. Seeking a rodent model to fill this niche, we are investigating neural mechanisms of vocal interaction in Alston’s singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina) – a neotropical rodent native to the cloud forests of Central America. We discovered sub-second temporal coordination of advertisement songs (counter-singing) between males of this species – a behavior that requires the rapid modification of motor outputs in response to auditory cues. We leveraged this natural behavior to probe the neural mechanisms that generate and allow fast and flexible vocal communication. Using causal manipulations, we recently showed that an orofacial motor cortical area (OMC) in this rodent is required for vocal interactions. Subsequently, in electrophysiological recordings, I find neurons in OMC that track initiation, termination and relative timing of songs. Interestingly, persistent neural dynamics during song progression stretches or compresses on every trial to match the total song duration. These results demonstrate robust cortical control of vocal timing in a rodent and questions the current dogma that motor cortical control of vocal output is evolutionarily restricted to the primate lineage.",Arkarup Banerjee,"Michael Long, NYU; ",New York University (grid.137628.9),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 20:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 20:15:00+00:00,
rec32r8kKGW0CgnEe,Dissecting Transient Burst Events,"Neural activity recorded from the scalp [magneto-/electroencephalogram (M/EEG)], cortical surface [electrocorticogram (EcoG)], or inside the brain [local field potential (LFP)] is traditionally analysed by averaging tens to hundreds of trials. The trial-wise average of spectrograms commonly shows periods of sustained high or low spectral power. The underlying single trial activity may manifest as oscillations (i.e., sustained rhythmic fluctuations of synchronous spiking activity) or burst-like events. Burst-like events are intermittent, transient periods of synchronous spiking activity. 
Events have a temporal, spectral, and spatial domain. However, most work so far has focussed on temporal event characteristics. Events are thereby compressed to a singular dimension, by reducing the spatial and spectral domains of their underlying signals. Domain reduction can have several un- wanted consequences. First, different domain reduction methods likely result in differences in event characteristics. Second, domain reduction can obscure interactions (e.g. temporal-spatial interaction also known as traveling wave) between domains, which may lead to ambiguous inferences and conclusions drawn from these analyses.
Considering all three domains will yield a more accurate description of individual event characteristics and their interactions. This is likely to underpin identification of more precise fingerprints of mechanisms underlying differences in population activity measures, such as spectral power. In turn, this can guide development of rational and mechanistically grounded treatments that target neurological and psychiatric conditions.",Catharina Zich,"Andrew J Quinn, University of Oxford; Lydia C Mardell, UCL; Nick S Ward, UCL; Sven Besmann, UCL",University College London (grid.83440.3b),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-28 13:00:00+00:00,2020-10-28 13:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/LWcqYzvlJ0A
rec33xZQRCKUO5Ep8,Paired Stimulation in the Human Limbic System Induced Functional Connectivity Changes Consistent with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity ,"Many neurological disorders can be attributed to abnormal neural dynamics at the network level, which arise from anomalous neural connectivity. As a result, spatially and temporally specific brain stimulation protocols can be designed to take advantage of our brain’s natural plasticity, reorganize selected neural connections, and serve as a potential therapy for various brain disorders. One of the proposed mechanisms for inducing targeted functional changes in the brain is spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which suggests that long-term potentiation (LTP) will be induced in two connected neurons when presynaptic spikes lead postsynaptic spikes by 0 to 20 ms. Although strong evidence of STDP has been found for synapses in vitro, its presence at the network level in awake human brains remains unclear. To investigate the relevance of STDP in humans, we applied paired-pulse electrical stimulation with different time delays, and recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from multiple epilepsy patients using implanted depth and electrocorticography (ECoG) grid electrodes. We assessed the functional connectivity between recorded brain regions in the limbic system as quantified by the coherence between LFPs. Our results showed that both stimulation paradigms significantly altered the functional connectivity between brain regions compared to control. Meanwhile, paired stimulation with 10-ms delay led to greater increase in LFP coherence compared to that with 100-ms delay across multiple frequency bands. These results support the role for an STDP-like process in the emotion processing regions of the human brain.",Jasmine Zhou,"Kira Evitts, University of Washington; Samantha Sun, University of Washington; Ankit Khambhati, University of California, San Francisco; Kristin Sellers, University of California, San Francisco; Edward Chang, University of California, San Francisco; Azadeh Yazdan-Shahmorad, Washington National Primate Research Center, University of Washington, and University of California, San Francisco",University of Washington (grid.34477.33),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-30 21:00:00+00:00,2020-10-30 21:15:00+00:00,
rec37Ge1ZKL0nqOOB,Batch Effects are Causal Effects: Applications in Human Functional Connectomes,"Batch effects, accidental sources of variance across multiple experiments, present a substantial hurdle for statistical inference. These batch effects have been implicated in multiple widespread problems, including the reproducibility crisis. Typical batch mitigation strategies, which normalize each dataset individually, view batch mitigation fundamentally as a statistical problem. We turn this view on its head, and cast batch effects as a causal problem, namely, the experimental site causes additional sources of variation, over and above the sources of variation within site. We applied this strategy to 24 datasets in the “Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility”. We illustrate that typical approaches amount to testing for independence, and therefore fail to address confounding variables. Such approaches are estimating the wrong estimand, and therefore, are invalid for quantifying batch effects when viewed from the causal perspective. Combining a causal view of batch mitigation with classical approaches (such as ComBat) yields satisfactory batch estimation and mitigation, while also preserving statistical patterns of interest. This framework can be applied to improve our understanding of the sources of batch effects, and enable more effective data aggregation strategies.

rec37oJEia2zNixnz,A motor adaptation paradigm to strengthen implicit learning,"When our intended movements have unintended outcomes, the human motor system can quickly adapt future movements. Motor output is modified in a way such that motor errors, that is, the difference between the expected and the perceived consequences of any motor output, are reduced. Both explicit and implicit neural processes play key roles in adaptation. Explicit processes, such as the effortful use of conscious strategies to counter a perturbation, can be quickly employed and allow for flexibility in rapidly changing conditions. Implicit processes on the other hand, such as the unconscious updating of internal models, supposedly arise slowly but do allow for reliable, persistent changes in the motor system. When adapting reaching movements, implicit components of adaptation have been demonstrated to have an upper boundary in the amount by which they alter future movements, regardless of the size of the experienced perturbation [1]; that is, they are thought to be limited in scope. Here, we allow participants to adapt to small, consistent errors, and when they have done so, introduce further small errors. Consequently, we show that the proposed upper boundary on implicit adaptation can be overcome. We also show that the additional implicit learning observed is not caused by simply gradually increasing the perturbation to prevent explicit strategies. This suggests that while additional implicit adaptation is difficult to achieve during tasks with large, salient errors, and in tasks with slowly introduced errors, it may be achievable by evoking multiple distinct error correction steps.

rec38VmOkfx5ENnv5,Development of autophagy-inducing peptides as a potential therapy for motor neurone disease ,"The pathological hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is the presence of protein inclusions and aggregates in affected neurons. Aggregates progress continually from the site of onset to disturb cellular processes, ultimately resulting in neuron degeneration1. The only intracellular degradative pathway that can purge the cells of these misfolded proteins, aggregates, and dysfunctional organelles is autophagy. Since impaired/reduced autophagy may contribute to MND pathogenesis; upregulating autophagy offers a potential therapeutic option. This study aimed to develop and synthesize novel pharmacological agents that have non-toxic autophagy-inducing properties in motor neuronal NSC-34 cells. A series of peptides analogues of the evolutionary conserved domain of Beclin1 protein, the master regulator of autophagy, were designed and synthesized. In order to enhance the cellular uptake and increase the cytosolic bioavailability, the peptides were cyclized, and conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide domain, and an endosomal escape domain. The autophagy-inducing effect of the peptides was determined by measuring the level of autophagosome-associated LC3-II, a marker of macroautophagy, in NSC-34 cells. We have shown that the peptides are capable of inducing autophagy at 5 micromolar concentration, which is 10-fold more potent than the previously reported Beclin-1 analogues. More importantly, the most potent peptide analogue significantly decreased aggregate-prone MND-associated protein levels and reduced their toxicity. This study provides in vitro evidence for a novel peptide-based approach to enhance autophagy as a unique and safe treatment modality with potential therapeutic benefit in MND and other proteinopathies.",Azin Amin,"Nirma Perrera, Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health; Bradley Turner, Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health; Fazel Shabanpoor, Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health",Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health (grid.418025.a),"Theme A: Development, Neurodegenerative Disorders and Injury",Traditional talk,2020-10-27 08:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 08:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/Z9fiZ-DZmhw
rec3D24f9WJwAwutq,Memory suppression and fear extinction related to emotional cues,"Background
Disparate research in animals and humans have shown reduced influence of fearful memory as an automatic process and a volitional process. It’s unclear whether volitional emotional memory suppression largely involves the same neural circuitry as automatic fear extinction.

Objective
To validate an examination of neural associations/dissociations between volitional memory suppression and fear extinction, we behaviorally tested both memory suppression and fear extinction. We aimed to identify what components of the memory are consciously reduced during suppression.

Methods
Participants (N=24) first learned 32 pairs of pictures: neutral human faces with either neutral images (NEU) or fearful scenes (NEG). Next, a neutral face would be shown and participants would be asked to either think about (THINK), suppress (NO THINK), or neither think about nor suppress (EXTINCT) the paired image; some faces weren’t shown (BASELINE). Participants then rated each face on how pleasant or unpleasant it made them feel and were asked to remember if the associated picture was negative or neutral.

Results
Within the ratings, there were significant main effects of Valence (p<.001), Condition (p<.001), and a significant interaction of Condition by Valence (p=.02). Think NEG showed that valence is lower than Baseline NEG (p = .012), while Extinction NEG showed that valence is higher than Baseline (p = .011).
Within the recall, there was a significant interaction of Condition by Valence (p=.02). NEG Think has the highest recall (92.71%) and there is a significant difference between NEG Think and NEG No Think (92.71 vs. 70.83%, p=.001) Additionally, NEG Think is significantly above baseline (p=.006), while NEG No Think is below baseline (although n.s., p=.38).
 
Conclusions
 Think related to enhancement in memory recall and the most negative ratings of the paired neutral faces. No Think was associated with worsened recall, but valence ratings were right around baseline. Extinction did not alter memory, but valence became less negative.

rec3FxIA1OSvNCRI1,The hippocampus promotes formation of long-term memory for objects in rats by preventing sensory interference after learning,"Damage to the medial temporal lobe, notably the hippocampus, often leads to anterograde amnesia for declarative memories, but it remains unresolved how this deficit arises. Addressing this issue, we have proposed in our active decay theory that the hippocampus supports long-term memory formation by protecting against ongoing sensory stimulation which interferes with the stabilisation of newly formed content representations residing in extra-hippocampal areas. Efficient pattern separation within the hippocampus is predicted to promote resistance to interference and representation overlap. Thus, without a functioning hippocampus, ongoing sensory stimulation will lead to states of catastrophic interference in these brain regions, manifesting behaviourally as anterograde amnesia. Here, we report our results testing this hypothesis with an object recognition task in rats as a model for human declarative memories. Importantly, expression of long-term object recognition memory requires the perirhinal cortex, not the hippocampus in rats. We found (1) that inactivating hippocampus prior to object learning with intrahippocampal injections of GABAA and -B agonists (muscimol+baclofen) impaired object recognition tested 24 h after learning. (2) This deficit was absent when we placed rats into a highly familiar dark chamber right after object learning to reduce sensory stimulation during the memory stabilization period. Our findings support our theoretical model and suggest that anterograde amnesia due to hippocampal damage arises from heightened vulnerability to interference from ongoing sensory stimulation during phases of memory stabilization.",Isabelle Groves,"Daisy Arkell, University of Edinburgh, Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences and Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain; Emma Wood, University of Edinburgh, Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences and Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain; Oliver Hardt, McGill University, Patrick Wild Centre and Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain",McGill University (grid.14709.3b),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Interactive talk,2020-10-27 13:00:00+00:00,2020-10-27 13:15:00+00:00,
rec3SIk5XIqDVWSb8,Assessing Limitations of Three-Factor Hebbian Learning Relative to Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Three-Factor Hebbian Learning (also known as Reward-Modulated Hebbian Learning) is an important framework for neuroscientists because it provides a biologically relevant framework for modeling learning in the brain. However, the effectiveness of Three-Factor Learning, which specifies that synaptic plasticity is driven only by presynaptic activity, postsynaptic activity, and a global neuromodulator, is limited. By contrast, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) provides more computationally powerful learning rules that typically use an additional factor related to the influence of the synapse or neuron towards the action taken by the agent. However, the biological relevance of these rules is less well understood. The primary goal of this project is to better understand the specific network and task conditions that cause Three-Factor Learning agents to fail, and the specific features of DRL algorithms that can overcome these problems and thus could potentially have relevance to learning in the brain.

We consider four primary challenges that the brain must overcome to learn effectively. The first is adding uncertainty to the time of stimulus onset on each trial, which is typically used in real-world learning tasks but less often in simulations. The second is adding multiple stimulus dimensions and changing which one is relevant for learning at a given time. The third is network complexity, including simply moving from a simple linear network that is used in many simple modeling exercises to a multi-layer network needed to solve more complex problems. The fourth is additional forms of plasticity, such as a perceptual learning-like mechanism that can affect the input to the network, that must interact synergistically with other learning in the network to produce appropriate outputs. Preliminary results suggest that each of these challenges are overcome more effectively by DRL algorithms than Three-Factor Hebbian rules, implying a potential role for those algorithms in the brain.",Jordan Lei,"Joshua Gold, University of Pennsylvania; Konrad Kording, University of Pennsylvania; Blake Richards, McGill University; Vijay Balasubramanian, University of Pennsylvania",University of Pennsylvania (grid.25879.31),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-29 20:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 20:15:00+00:00,

In a sample of healthy adults (N=332) we determined that task-based networks implicated in attention, empathy, and ToM-processing are topologically ordered along a social gradient from internal to external cognitive functions and have differentiable behavioral, functional, and genetic associations. We found domain-specific change in functional topology following a mental training intervention addressing attention and interoception, socio-affective skills, and socio-cognitive skills respectively. Attention-based practice resulted in segregation of cortical association networks, whereas socio-cognitive training resulted in their integration, reflecting a dissociation between cognitive quiescence and active thought. Socio-affective training had balancing effects on functional network organization, related to the regulating function of emotion. Together, our results show that social interaction involves a modifiable balance of network integration and segregation embedded along a social gradient from external to internal cognitive functions.",Sofie Valk,"Philipp Kanske, TU Dresden, Germany; Bo-yong Park, MNI, Canada; Seok-Jun Hong, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea; Anne Böckler-Raettig, University of Hannover, Germany; Fynn-Mathis Trautwein, University of Freiburg, Germany; Boris C.

rec3dHFdee4L66pbj,Epigenetic signature of FKBP5 is associated with structural changes in emotion regulatory brain circuits,"Disturbances in regulatory brain circuits involved in neural stress and emotion processing are commonly observed across many psychiatric disorders. Prominently, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) serve as convergence sites for genetic and environmental risk factors. Epigenetic disinhibition of FKBP5, a regulator of the HPA-axis, might be a biological mechanism that translates environmental influences into altered brain function. Two specific DNA-Methylation (DNAm) loci have recently been identified as being particularly relevant for the epigenetic regulation of FKBP5. Here, we investigate the brain structural correlates of these epigenetic loci. In total 395 (194 women; age:28.12±10.45) healthy caucasian subjects underwent structural T1 MRI-Scans. Data was preprocessed using the CAT12 toolbox (in SPM12) following standard procedures. DNAm was assessed using the Illumina EPIC array and residualized for sex, age, cell composition, smoking and the first 10 PCs. The DNAm of the two loci of interest, cg20813374 and cg00130530, were averaged. Two General Linear Models on grey matter volume with (i) FKBP5 DNAm [n=395] and (ii) the trait version of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) [n=224] as predictors were build. Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses with ROI comprising  ACC, mPFC, Hippocampus and Amygdala were conducted. FKBP5 DNAm was significantly associated with grey matter volume in the medial Orbitofrontal Cortex (T=4.37, p=.030 Family-wise error (FWE)-corrected in ROI). Within the FKBP5-dependent morphometric changes trait anxiety was negatively associated with perigenual ACC volume (T=-3.61, p=.044 FWE-corrected in ROI). We demonstrate that DNAm of key loci in FKBP5 and established risk markers for affective disorders converge on the same regions within a well-known brain circuits underlying neural stress processing, highlighting the importance of brain circuits in translating epigenetic into psychological risk.",Thomas Leon Kremer,"Thomas Leon Kremer, University Heidelberg; Urs Braun, University Heidelberg; Junfang Chen, University Heidelberg; Anais Harneit, University Heidelberg; Kristina Schwarz, University Heidelberg; Janina I.

rec3eJckWkHry1ZqR,Emergent Sequential Task Learning Facilitates Convergence in Recurrent Neural Networks,"Neuronal networks can learn to maintain stimulus information in order to solve working memory tasks. Here, tasks are defined by their loss function that is optimised to solve the task. Loss functions can vary in difficulty, and various machine learning strategies have been developed to catalyse learning, such as drop-out, adaptive learning rates and various gradient descent methods. But these are all technical improvements of the involved algorithms, and do not inform us of how animal learning might be improved. Instead, we have identified a different, non-trivial strategy to improve learning, by adding a second, easier task to the loss function. Our original task requires a recurrent neural network to report the trial type at the end of each trial, by accumulating information throughout the trial. This is a difficult task to learn, and networks often fail to converge. This changes when an additional component is added to the loss function that requires networks to make short-term predictions throughout the trial, thus informing them of the trial structure. Networks emerge to learn to solve the second task first, thereby changing the functional profile of their neurons, after which they also learn to minimise the first component of the loss function. This unsupervised, sequential learning behaviour provides a new perspective on task optimisation. It shows that networks can decompose a loss function and learn its parts in an optimal sequence. This principle could potentially be applied to other difficult tasks, arguing that they may be solved by using additional, easier tasks, serving as a warm start to the network.",Thijs van der Plas,"Sanjay Manohar, University of Oxford; Tim Vogels, IST Vienna;",University of Oxford (grid.4991.5),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-30 12:00:00+00:00,2020-10-30 12:15:00+00:00,
rec3kU0WlhO2ckCpR,Ethical considerations for vocal biomarker research,"Over 30 million Americans – roughly 8% of the U.S. population - are affected by psychiatric and neurological diseases (PaNDs). Despite this high prevalence, few cost-effective tools exist to objectively diagnose PaNDs early. As a result, PaNDs are usually treated only after advanced symptoms appear, leading to high costs and poor patient outcomes. There is thus a strong need to create low-cost and highly accurate biomarkers to streamline early-stage PaNDs diagnosis.

Perhaps the most promising area for early diagnosis of PaNDs is through vocal biomarkers. There are multiple benefits to this approach including: 1) the cost to acquire and process voice data is low (~$0.03/sample); 2) the tools to collect voice data are widely accessible (68% of US population owns a smartphone); and 3) voice-based machine learning models are highly accurate at detecting symptoms of PaNDs up to five years earlier relative to the standard of care (e.g. in Alzheimer’s disease).

Despite great promise, the potential rapid growth of the voice space raises a host of early neuroethical concerns.  As the voice tech space grows, individuals may become subject to algorithmic bias. Algorithmic bias has manifested in the facial recognition space, for example, due to the lack of diversity in datasets. The shortcomings of these datasets result in a spectrum of unwanted bias - from not unlocking your own phone to being falsely arrested as a wanted criminal. 

The voice space can prevent algorithmic bias early on by monitoring the data collected and use of technology. Rather than collecting as much data as possible to train initial predictive algorithms, the voice space must ensure that the data is representative of diverse populations in order to mitigate harmful biases.

rec3lIIu46hqa7XPK,Modulating RPTPσ promotes functional recovery in experimental models of multiple sclerosis ,"Changes in chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) following neural injury or as part of a neurodegenerative process lead to the inhibition of myelin repair. In Multiple sclerosis, CSPGs are deposited at the border of active and expanding demyelinating lesions and may create a barrier for regeneration and contribute to neurodegeneration. CSPG inhibition of axonal regeneration is partially mediated by the protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPσ) receptor. PTPσ is also the main player of CSPG inhibition of oligodendrocyte (OL) outgrowth and myelination. Intracellular sigma peptide (ISP) binds to PTPσ and relieves CSPG-mediated inhibition and has been used to promote regeneration after spinal cord injury. Identification of PTPσ as a functional receptor for CSPGs presents a promising avenue of investigation to rescue OL activity and promote recovery in demyelinating lesions.

Here we show that ISP treatment can improve functional recovery in animal models of multiple sclerosis and highlight cellular changes involved in the process. The EAE mice treated with ISP significantly recovered hindlimb function, and showed considerably reduced neuroinflammation and immune infiltration, smaller demyelinating lesion sites, and significantly more neurofilament sparing. After systemic demyelination, mice that received ISP showed motor and cognitive improvements that correlated with increased remyelination and decreased neuroinflammation.  We further demonstrate that delaying ISP administration by two weeks in a chronic disease model leads to a lesser degree of functional and histological improvements while still significantly improving the condition, highlighting the importance of modulating CSPG signalling at an incipient stage of the disease. In vitro, astrocytes, microglia and OPCs exposed to CSPGs showed inhibitory responses that were ameliorated by ISP addition .  Overall, our results suggest an exciting avenue for regeneration by targeting RPTPσ, supporting further consideration for therapeutic usage.

What neural strategies produce this flexibility? Can they be predicted and understood by network modeling? We trained monkeys to perform a cycling task at different speeds, and trained artificial recurrent networks to generate the empirical muscle-activity patterns. Network solutions, combined with the principle that noise-robust dynamics require low trajectory tangling, yielded quantitative and qualitative predictions. To evaluate predictions, we recorded motor cortex population activity during the same task. Responses supported the hypothesis that the dominant neural signals reflect not muscle activity per se, but network-level strategies for generating muscle activity across speeds. Single-neuron responses were better described when regressed against network activity than when regressed against muscle activity. More deeply, population-level neural trajectories were structured differently from muscle trajectories. Neural trajectories had an organization that maintained low trajectory tangling within and across speeds, matching the structure of network solutions.",Shreya Saxena,"Abigail Russo, Princeton University; John Cunningham, Columbia University; Mark Churchland, Columbia University",University of Florida (grid.15276.37),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-28 13:00:00+00:00,2020-10-28 13:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/sG7seYr4QH4
rec3pJ108cKCsuLT1,Sensorimotor beta activity is transient even during sustained motor output,"Recently, it has been suggested that beta-frequency patterns of neural activity (13-30Hz) are transient rather than sustained. However, to date, this has been demonstrated predominantly in studies with non-sustained task demands. Here, we revisited the transient vs. sustained nature of sensorimotor beta activity in an isometric contraction task designed to yield sustained behavioural output. During sustained muscle contraction, beta activity in sensorimotor cortices is known to become coherent with the muscle, resulting in cortico-muscular coherence (CMC). We hypothesised that if CMC is responsible for sustained motor contraction, beta activity should be sustained in this context. We measured magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electromyography (EMG) while participants (N = 18) performed a sustained motor task (gripping). To accurately disentangle the burst vs. sustained oscillation scenarios, we analysed MEG time-series in motor channels with Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) – a data-driven signal decomposition method with high temporal resolution. We replicated the finding that beta activity is modulated by global task structure: beta power in motor brain areas and the muscle was particularly prominent while participants held a steady grip. Correspondingly, we observed beta CMC during gripping. Nevertheless, at the single trial level, beta activity in the brain and the muscle appeared transient. When collapsing all periods of high and low beta power in the brain (beta ON and OFF periods), we confirmed that transient ON periods in the brain were paralleled by a corresponding short-lasting increase in beta power in the muscle and by a similarly time-limited CMC, despite sustained motor output. These transient beta ON periods were not due to transient changes in participants’ grip. We finally found that beta “bursts” during gripping were of similarly short duration as those recorded in the same participants during rest. Together, these findings show that beta activity and connectivity is “bursty” even during sustained motor output.",Irene Echeverria Altuna,"Andrew J.

rec3w6zWZyqG8xzAI,Amodal statistical completion of occluded objects ,"It is well known that the visual system amodally completes occluded edges in a display. But real-world objects have more complex edges and yet, we have no trouble recognizing them even when they are occluded. Does our visual system extrapolate more complex types of information based on the statistics of the visible portion of an object? To answer this question, we performed a series of visual search experiments. We created occluded displays in which a shape was occluded in its top-left corner, and two alternative shapes whose contours were identical in the unoccluded portion but differed in the occluded portion such that one appeared to be the more likely object behind the occluder, and the other more unlikely. We then asked whether perceptual dissimilarities measured using visual search in the occluded conditions were correlated with the perceptual dissimilarities of the likely pairs or unlikely pairs. Across different sets of shapes organized on candidate features for perceptual completion (here: ‘numerosity’ of protrusions,  ‘curvature’ between straight edges etc.), we observed that occluded dissimilarities were more correlated with the likely shape dissimilarities (r = 0.90, p < 0.0005 for ‘numerosity’ set and r = 0.89, p < 0.0005 for ‘curvature’ set’) compared to unlikely shape dissimilarities (r = 0.68, p < 0.0005 for ‘numerosity’ set and r = 0.80, p < 0.0005 for ‘curvature’ set’). Taken together, our results show that amodal completion is far more complex than is believed, in that it can not only extrapolate simple edges but use statistical properties to complete occluded portions of objects.

rec41Gor8F8Wmx3B7,Comparative Study of Fruit Fly Brain Circuit Models with FlyBrainLab,"Comparison of circuit models, either among versions developed by one’s own, or among those published in literature, is the critical but often neglected step towards discovering the functional logic of brain circuits. Three types of comparisons are of particular interest. The first is, starting from a given dataset and after building a number of circuit models published in the literature, to analyze and compare them under the same evaluation criteria. The second is to automate the construction of executable circuits from datasets gathered by different labs and, to analyze, evaluate and compare the different circuit realizations. The third is to analyze, evaluate and compare brain circuits at different developmental stages.

We recently developed the FlyBrainLab interactive computing platform whose main capabilities include 1) 3D exploration and visualization of fruit fly brain data, 2) creation of executable circuits directly from the fly brain data explored in step 1), and 3) interactive exploration of the functional logic of the devised executable circuits. Consequently, FlyBrainLab automates and greatly simplifies the construction of and the comparison between executable fly brain circuits.

To demonstrate the comprehensive capabilities of the FlyBrainLab, we present, respectively, three comparative studies of fruit fly brain circuit models. In the first example, we compare three circuit models of the fruit fly central complex from the literature, all based on the FlyCircuit dataset. In the second example, we demonstrate the effect on modeling the Antenna and the Antennal Lobe circuits developed upon, respectively, the FlyCircuit and the Hemibrain datasets.

Some of the key characteristics of FXS include visual processing abnormalities, visual-motor function deficits and social deficits. However, little is known about the developmental trajectory of FXS, particularly early visual processing and its effect on visually driven behaviours. Utilizing the unique advantages of the zebrafish model system, here we used behavioural recordings of zebrafish hunting events combined with in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of the optic tectum to assess functional changes between fmr1-/- and fmr1+/- larval zebrafish at 5, 9 and 14 days post-fertilisation (dpf). fmr1-/- fish showed early deficits in natural hunting behaviours, delayed development of neural coding in the optic tectum, and altered development trajectory in tectal network properties. However, these metrics improved in the fmr1/- fish when they were exposed to reduced sensory stimulation during development. We then assessed social behaviour at 28 dpf, and found that fmr1-/- fish displayed increased social preference compared to wild-type fish but slower reactions to conspecific movement.

Although the use of IVCs has clear benefits, there have been unanticipated drawbacks. Some research has suggested that IVCs may lead to increased rodent stress levels, however, the exact cause for this increase remains unknown. One cage-condition that is unique to IVCs, and may be responsible for increasing stress levels, is the air pressure environment inside the cage. IVCs can be operated under negative or positive pressure, however, little is known about how air pressure might influence behaviour. The social housing of rodents in OTCs is known to buffer rodents’ responses to stress, and is a well-validated phenomenon termed “social buffering”. At present, it is unknown if this phenomenon carries over to rodents housed in IVCs, and if this “social buffering” response is dependent on the type of air pressure. Rats were randomly assigned to single- or paired-housing in IVCs under negative or positive pressure. Five weeks after housing assignment, rats’ anxiety-like behaviour was measured in the elevated plus maze (EPM), and their brain tissue was processed to examine oxytocin-immunoreactivity (OT-ir) in the hypothalamus. The anxiety-reducing effects of pair-housing were only evident in rats housed under positive pressure. Although there were no differences in the number of OT-ir cells in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus between single- and pair-housed animals, a higher number of OT-ir cells in the PVN was significantly correlated with decreased anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that IVCs may be altering well-validated behavioural profiles in rodents, and this may be in part due to the unique cage-conditions that IVCs present. As such, this research aims to improve the welfare of laboratory rodents by refining and improving their housing conditions.

rec4GzCZxlBMOg4A6,How trial correlations and feedback shape sequential decision-making,"To make the best decisions, organisms must flexibly accumulate information, accounting for what is relevant, and ignoring what is not. However, many decision-making studies focus on sequences of independent trials in which the evidence gathered to make a choice and the resulting actions are irrelevant to future decisions. An important and naturalistic aspect of such experiments is a probabilistic schedule of rewards, in which sometimes correct responses are not rewarded and sometimes incorrect responses are. For example, birds may correctly identify a fruitful tree but have difficulty harvesting the fruit. Normative theory has been developed for such tasks when reward is the sole evidence (e.g., two-armed bandit tasks), but less is known about how an observer should integrate probabilistic rewards that are interspersed with noisy evidence to inform their decisions in correlated trials. To understand decision-making under more natural conditions, we propose and analyze models of ideal observers who accumulate evidence to freely make choices across a sequence of correlated trials and receive uncertain feedback. We extend drift-diffusion models to obtain the normative form of evidence accumulation in a series of trials with the correct choice evolving as a two-state Markov process. We analyze three different feedback cases: no trial-to-trial feedback, probabilistic trial-to-trial feedback, and probabilistic reward as feedback. Ideal observers integrate noisy evidence within a trial until reaching a decision threshold and bias their initial belief depending on the evidence accumulated and feedback received on previous trials. Ideal observers optimize their reward rate across trials by adjusting their sequence of decision thresholds to deliberate longer on early decisions and respond more quickly in later trials. We show how conflicts between feedback and accumulated evidence are resolved, and under which conditions one of them dominates. Our findings are consistent with experimentally observed response trends.",Khanh Nguyen,"Kresimir Josic, University of Houston; Zachary Kilpatrick, University of Colorado Boulder",German Primate Center (grid.418215.b),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-29 09:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 09:30:00+00:00,

The  cellular  and  molecular  mechanisms regulating  the  specific  sequential  steps  of  radial  neuronal  migration  in  vivo  are  however  still  unclear.  Recent evidence  suggests  that  distinct  signaling  cues  act  cell-autonomously  but  differentially  at  particular  steps during  the  overall  migration  process.  Functional  MADM  (Mosaic  Analysis  with  Double  Markers)  analyses in  comparison  to  global  knockout  also  indicate  a  significant  degree  of  non-cell-autonomous  and/or community  effects  in  the  control  of  cortical  neuron  migration.

It  is  therefore  not  only  essential  to  determine  the  nature  of  the  interplay  of  cellautonomous  and  non-cell-autonomous  mechanisms  but  also  how  they  control  cortical  neuronal  migration.

A systematic review.,"Increase in life-span in our society is a double-edged sword that entails a growing number of patients with neurocognitive disorders, being Alzheimer’s disease (AD) the most prevalent. Advances in medical imaging and computational power, allow new methods to detect and hopefully prevent cognitive decline, especially in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition that might be considered a prodromal stage of AD. We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines of studies where Machine Learning (ML) was applied to neuroimaging data obtained from public databases in order to predict the progression from MCI to AD. We selected 30 studies and assessed their model performance based on its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, to determine which algorithms combined with which neuroimaging techniques achieved better predictions. Results show that the best method to detect group differences between healthy, MCI (progressive and stable), and AD subjects is using large samples with multimodal and multidimensional data (neuroimage, clinical, cognitive, biological, and behavioral data) combined with Deep Learning models (as compared with other ML models such as Random Forest or Support Vector Machine).

rec4IgbMczDxdEiBl,Reach-relevant somatosensory signals modulate the neural correlates of tactile suppression,"Tactile signals arising from goal-directed movements are typically suppressed. This results mainly from an internal model predicting sensory consequences of the movement, and attenuating those feedback signals matching the predictions. Feedback signals are, however, important to successfully control goal-directed movements requiring a flexible modulation of these signals. Despite behavioral evidence supporting such modulations of tactile suppression, the neural implementation of this modulation is not clear. Here, we investigated the neural correlates of tactile suppression during reaching movements targeted either to a static finger (somatosensory reach) or to a touchscreen (external reach). In the latter case, reach-relevant signals arose only from the moving hand, while in the former case additional feedback signals from the target hand were available. To probe tactile suppression, participants received brief vibrotactile stimuli to the moving finger prior to reach. Somatosensory and external reaches resulted in tactile suppression compared to resting (baseline), with stronger suppression during somatosensory than external reaches, as expected. At the neural level, BOLD activation associated with suppression was modulated by the reach goal: processing of probes during somatosensory reaching led to distinct BOLD deactivations in fronto-parietal regions compared to baseline and external reaching. These deactivations were more pronounced during somatosensory than external reaching in regions linked with somatosensory processing (postcentral gyrus, anterior insula), and sensorimotor prediction and integration (supplementary motor area, supramarginal gyrus). Our results suggest modulation of movement-related somatosensory signals in regions associated with predictive and feedback processing.

rec4KkUgbzBCARvgM,Differences between representations shaped by supervised and unsupervised learning rules,"How the brain adjusts the synapses of individual neurons to support learning is an essential question in neuroscience. Backpropagation is the current most efficient solution for this problem in deep neural networks, and may be approximated by the brain to some extent. On the other hand, unsupervised learning rules like various forms of Hebbian learning are experimentally well supported, and are critical both during circuit development and learning from sensory information without supervision signals. The combination of supervised and unsupervised learning rules has therefore the potential to produce plasticity mechanisms that are both biologically plausible and can exploit their advantages. Here we study a learning rule combining backpropagation of gradients and an unsupervised Hebbian rule with competition between neurons, in a network receiving natural images as stimuli. The backpropagation objective is the image classification accuracy, while Hebbian learning causes emergence of typical visual receptive fields such as edge detectors, as well as less structured, random-looking kernels.  Results suggest while combined learning has similar classification performance with backpropagation alone, changes due to backpropagation may be small compared to changes of unsupervised learning. Structured receptive fields shaped by unsupervised learning result in a sparser contribution of neurons to correct prediction. When initialised from both random and structured kernels, random kernels tend to get more changes during backpropagation. Though unsupervised learned kernels seem to be slightly hindering the efficiency of backpropagation, they can better support transfer learning between classes. These suggest that top-down influences on early sensory receptive fields may generally be weak and experimentally hard to detect. The work is a first step in studying how to combine supervised and unsupervised learning rules to bring out respective advantages as well as learn in a more biologically plausible manner.",Ada Duan,Matthias Hennig,University of Edinburgh (grid.4305.2),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-29 20:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 20:30:00+00:00,

rec4PvCHIZ64GEw2l,A miniature microscope  for neuro + vascular imaging in freely moving animals,"Imaging multiple variables that characterize brain function in neuroscientific and preclinical animal models permits a better understanding of neurophysiology and its disruption in disease. However, multi-variable imaging systems need to acquire images with multiple contrasts, and therefore require inclusion of many optical components which make them large and stationary. Moreover, such systems are often custom designed, expensive, and restrict experimentation due to the need for anesthesia or animal head fixation. To overcome these challenges, we developed a portable, low-cost, miniature optical microscope capable of imaging three optical contrasts over a 3x3 mm2 field of view at 5 µm resolution. The microscope consists of a fluorescence (FL) channel for imaging neural activity (e.g. via GCaMP) or fluorescently tagged cells (e.g. 9L-GFP cancer cells); an intrinsic optical signal (IOS) channel for imaging hemoglobin absorption (i.e. cerebral blood volume); and a laser speckle contrast (LSC) channel for imaging perfusion (i.e. cerebral blood flow). Weighing 3g after strain relief, it can be used to conduct neuroimaging in freely behaving mice. 

First we compared images acquired via the miniature microscope for each channel with those acquired from a non-miniaturized imaging system, and demonstrated a high degree of correlation. We then used it to interrogate neurovascular coupling in an awake mouse auditory cortex in relation to two distinct sound stimuli at 4 kHz and 24 kHz, and characterized the unique spatial and temporal relationship between neuronal, vasodilatory and blood flow responses to each stimuli. We also used our microscope to investigate in vivo the progression of a brain tumor throughout the tumor’s life-cycle and mapped the stages of angiogenesis and the establishment of patent blood flow within the tumor microenvironment. 

We are working on the next generation of our microscope and looking for strategic partners to enable exciting discoveries in both basic neuroscience and preclinical research.

rec4PxbbLrw5krSY3,The SNARE regulator Complexin 3 is a target of the cone circadian clock,"Almost all living organisms have evolved rhythms of behavior and physiology to allow them to occupy temporal niches. One such rhythm is a circadian rhythm which allows organisms to preemptively adapt to changes in environment conditions driven by the daily light/dark cycle. Rhythms are generated by cell autonomous molecular clocks which drive rhythmic cell processes. BMAL1 is a core component of the mammalian circadian clockwork. Removal of BMAL1 from the retina significantly affects visual information processing in both rod and cone pathways. To identify potential pathways and/or molecules through which BMAL1 alters signal transmission at the cone pedicle, we performed an RNA‐seq differential expression analysis between cone‐specific Bmal1 knockout cones (cone‐Bmal1−/−) and wild‐type (WT) cones. We found 88 genes differentially expressed. Among these, Complexin3 (Cplx3), a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses, was downregulated fivefold in the mutant cones. The purpose of this work was to determine whether BMAL1 and/or the cone clock controls CPLX3 protein expression at cone pedicles. We found that CPLX3 expression level was decreased twofold in cone‐Bmal1−/− cones. Furthermore, CPLX3 expression was downregulated at night compared to the day in WT cones but remained constitutively low in mutant cones both day and night. The transcript and protein expression levels of Cplx4—the other complexin expressed in cones—were similar in WT and mutant cones; in WT cones, CPLX4 protein level did not change with the time of day. In silico analysis revealed four potential BMAL1:CLOCK binding sites upstream from exon one of Cplx3 and none upstream of exon one of Cplx4. Our results suggest that CPLX3 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the cone clock. The modulation of CPLX3 may be a mechanism by which the clock controls the cone synaptic transfer function to second‐order cells and thereby impacts retinal signal processing during the day/night cycle.",Jacob Bhoi (he/him),"Zhijing Zhang, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX; Christophe P.

One of the harmful outcomes of presence of LPS in the brain is the cognitive impairment which is a result of a downstream inflammatory responses that had been initiated in the gut.
In animal models these cognitive impairments include lethargy, arched or curled body posture, inactivity, and reduced consumption. Socialization in animals is positively correlated with physical and mental, learning, and reduced mortality. The main goal of this study is to investigate if socialization through co-housing has a direct therapeutic effect on LPS induced neuroinflammation.
We utilized an LPS-induced endotoxemia model for our experiments. A total of 24 mice C57/BL6 mice were divided into two groups: socially isolated mice or co-housed mice.
Continuous seventy-two hours recording sessions were performed and videos were analyzed and scored. We found that co-housing mice not only reduced the recovery time but also decreased the duration of exhibition of the sickness behavior. Analysis showed that the single-housed mice displays sickness behavior, including extended hunched posture, for about thirty-five minutes following the LPS injection, while the co-house mice only spent twelve minutes displaying sickness behavior. In addition, there was a significant weigh loss in the LPS injected mice. Motion tracking analysis revealed that socially isolated LPS injected mice remained stationary for hours compared to co-housed mice. 
In conclusion, our findings show that co-housing mice post endotoxemia endotoxemia demonstrate therapeutic which could be further exploited for translational studies.

rec4R94ans8hdAB1P,Modeling Task Effects on Meaning Representation in the Brain via Zero-Shot MEG Prediction,"How meaning is represented in the brain is still one of the big open questions in neuroscience. Does a word (e.g., bird) always have the same representation, or does the task under which the word is processed alter its representation (answering “can you eat it?” versus “can it fly?”)? The brain activity of subjects who read the same word while performing different semantic tasks has been shown to differ across tasks. However, it is still not understood how the task itself contributes to this difference. In the current work, we study Magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain recordings of participants tasked with answering questions about concrete nouns. We investigate the effect of the task (i.e. the question being asked) on the processing of the concrete noun by predicting the millisecond-resolution MEG recordings as a function of both the semantics of the noun and the task. Using this approach, we test several hypotheses about the task-stimulus interactions by comparing the zero-shot predictions made by these hypotheses for novel tasks and nouns not seen during training. We find that incorporating the task semantics significantly improves the prediction of MEG recordings, across participants. The improvement occurs 475 − 550ms after the participants first see the word, which corresponds to what is considered to be the ending time of semantic processing for a word. These results suggest that only the end of semantic processing of a word is task-dependent, and pose a challenge for future research to formulate new hypotheses for earlier task effects as a function of the task and stimuli.",Mariya Toneva,"Mariya Toneva, Carnegie Mellon University; Otilia Stretcu, Carnegie Mellon University; Barnabas Poczos, Carnegie Mellon University; Leila Wehbe, Carnegie Mellon University; Tom Mitchell, Carnegie Mellon University",Carnegie Mellon University (grid.147455.6),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-27 16:00:00+00:00,2020-10-27 16:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/bo9dGx9EPis

Here we tested how attentional window, i.e. how widely we can distribute our attention around a certain fixation location when searching for an item among distractors, changes with aging. Specifically, we investigated whether aging resulted in a decrease in attentional window during easy or parallel visual search (global processing). We also tested whether performance in visual search was related to perceptual visual function with a contrast detection task and two motion tasks (local and global motion perception) at two different eccentricities (5° and 10° eccentricity). We measured the size of the attentional window using different sized gaze-contingent visible windows in 12 younger adults and 11 older adults during a pop-out visual search task. Older adults showed a significantly smaller attentional window (M = 19.4°, SD = 3.3°) compared to younger adults (M = 23.2°, SD = 2.3°). They also had significantly higher contrast detection thresholds (M older = 9.3%, SD older = 5.1%; M younger = 4.5%, SD younger = 2.8%) and required longer durations to estimate global motion (M older = 442.8 ms, SD older = 214.2 ms; M younger = 181.4 ms, SD younger = 75.3 ms).

In the domain of memory, the emotional valence and arousal of memorized stimuli can modulate both the acuity and content of episodic recall. However, no experiment has investigated whether arousal and valence also influence metacognition for memory (i.e., the process of self-monitoring memories). In a pre-registered study, we applied a novel psychophysiological design together with computational models of metacognition to assess the influence of stimulus valence and arousal on the sensitivity, bias, and efficiency of metamemory. To estimate the role of physiological arousal in mediating these effects, we recorded cardiac measures through pulse oximetry. We found that negative valence globally and substantially decreased both memory performance and subjective confidence, in particular for low-arousal words. Simultaneously, we found that emotional valence modulated both heart rate and heart-rate variability (HRV), indicating a robust effect of negative valence on physiological arousal during recognition memory. Exploratory trial-level analyses further revealed that subjective confidence was encoded in instantaneous heart-rate fluctuations, and that this relationship was modulated by emotional valence.

rec4tk4vwjOQQaZyA,A Method for Distinguishing Between Feedforward and Feedback Influences on Neural Responses,"This neural activity of sensory neurons is not just the result of external stimuli - what may be thought of as a feedforward drive - but is also influenced by feedback signals reflecting internal variables. Distinguishing between the effects of external and internal influences on neural responses is therefore an important question for neural coding and in particular understanding the nature of response covariability (“noise correlations”). In prior studies, changes in neural covariability between different behavioral contexts were taken as evidence for the influence of feedback signals (Cohen & Newsome 2008, Bondy et al. 2018). Here, we propose a method to estimate the magnitude of task-related feedback without the need for data on a second task, by comparing neural variability in the task-relevant direction with the neural variability in other, equivalent directions in neural population response space. We validate our method using a model of realistic covariability induced by shared feedforward noise based on Kanitscheider et al. (2015). We extend that model by incorporating learnt receptive fields as well as variable feedback whose strength acts as ground truth for validating our method. In addition to a detailed analysis of the resulting correlation structure, we identify failure modes of the proposed method and perform a power analysis to obtain estimates of how much data is needed to reliably distinguish feedback from feedforward sources depending on the strength of the feedback injected.

rec4utBectUgHAKEh,Activation of 5-HT2A receptors reconfigures cortico-limbic functional connectivity in rats,"5-HT2a receptor activation may contribute to the potential antidepressant effects of psychedelics.  5-HT2a agonists have been shown to induce High Frequency Oscillations (HFO, 125-145Hz) in diverse brain regions, but the mechanisms and relevance of these oscillations remain unclear.  Here, we quantify the effects of a selective 5-HT2a agonist 25I-NBOH (25I) on functional connectivity in the cortico-limbic system of behaving rats.  
5 adult male Wistar rats were implanted with local field potential recording electrodes in basolateral amygdala (BLA), dorsal hippocampus (dCA1), infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PrL) cortex.  Baseline recordings in a familiar open field were followed by intraperitoneal injection of 25I (2mg/kg) or vehicle.  LFP power, coherence and pairwise spectral multivariate granger causality (GC) were analysed for pre-injection, early post-injection (5-10 minutes) and late post-injection (35-40 minutes) periods. 
25I reduced movement and increased the proportion of time spent at the open field perimeter.  25I induced reductions in broadband spectral power across all four regions, but increases in high-gamma (65-80Hz) in the BLA and HFO in BLA, IL and PRL.  HFO peaks were most pronounced in IL.  High-gamma and HFO coherence between IL, PRL and BLA increased; coherence between CA1 and other regions showed only a slight increase in the HFO range. 
25I caused a marked increase in high-gamma GC from IL to BLA relative to pre-injection or vehicle, and a marked increase in HFO GC from IL to PRL.  In the early post injection period, there was an increase in HFO GC from dCA1 to BLA.
Our data evidence a 5-HT2A receptor-mediated increase in functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala with an increase in “top down” control of the amygdala by the IL. These changes may contribute to the network basis of antidepressant effects of psychedelic drugs including psilocybin and ketamine.

rec4w5y1RJbO1ah65,"Synaptic scaling requires a balance between stability, efficiency, and accuracy in realistic neuron morphologies ","Synaptic scaling is a homeostatic normalization mechanism that preserves relative synaptic strengths by adjusting them with a common factor.  This multiplicative change is believed to be critical, since synaptic strengths are involved in learning and memory retention.  Further, this homeostatic process is thought to be crucial for neuronal stability, playing a stabilizing role in otherwise runaway Hebbian plasticity.  Synaptic scaling requires a mechanism to sense total neuron activity and globally adjust synapses to achieve some activity set-point. This process is relatively slow, which places limits on its ability to stabilize network activity.  We show that this slow response is inevitable in realistic neuronal morphologies. Furthermore, we reveal that global scaling can in fact be a source of instability unless responsiveness or scaling accuracy are sacrificed.

A neuron with tens of thousands of synapses must regulate its own excitability to compensate for changes in input.  The time requirement for global feedback can introduce critical phase lags in a neuron’s response to perturbation.  Realization of the phase lag instability requires a unified model of synaptic scaling, regulation, and transport.  We present such a model with global and local feedback in realistic neuron morphologies.  This combined model shows that neurons face a tradeoff between stability, accuracy, and efficiency.  Global feedback is required for synaptic scaling but favors either system stability or efficiency.  Large receptor pools improve scaling accuracy in large morphologies but worsen both stability and efficiency.  Local feedback improves the stability-efficiency tradeoff at the cost of scaling accuracy.  This project introduces unexplored constraints on neuron size, morphology, and synaptic scaling.  We describe the interplay between global and local feedback mechanisms required to balance accurate synaptic scaling with neuron stability.

rec53f6Jhrv6gNMRa,TASER (Temporally Adaptive SourcE Reconstruction),"Source reconstruction is a ubiquitous yet complex and critical pre-processing step in MEG and EEG analysis. Existing approaches have enjoyed great success, but nearly always assume stationarity in the source space covariance, a constraint which confounds the accuracy of source localisation (Barratt et al., 2018). Here we present TASER (Temporally Adaptive SourcE Reconstruction), a fully unsupervised algorithm which learns time-point specific reconstruction weights to build source space images. Specifically, we infer regularised time-varying data and noise covariance matrices at the same temporal resolution of the data. This is achieved by employing a stochastic gradient variational Bayesian inference framework, featuring gated recurrent unit neural networks. We show in simulation that TASER improves upon conventional static (minimum norm and beamformer) estimates in 3 out of 4 criteria. Applying the algorithm to real data, we show that TASER is able to uncover task-relevant physiological dynamics in an unsupervised fashion, negating the need to manually segregate data into different trial conditions. By automatically accounting for differences in covariance between timepoints, we replicate the findings of Barratt et al. (2018) and map the post movement beta rebound of digits 1 and 5 in motor cortex using MEG data, demonstrating the increase in spatial resolution over conventional static approaches to source reconstruction. This new unsupervised technique has exciting potential applications to datasets where there is little to no pre-supposed task structure e.g. during the resting state.",Ryan Timms,"Ryan C.

rec563nK5Ft60krB0,Novel Function of Brain Tissue-Specific MicroRNA-124 in Regulating Mesodermal Cell Fate ,"MicroRNA-124 (miR-124) has a highly conserved role in regulating the intricate balance between proliferation and differentiation during neurogenesis. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the novel role this neuron-specific microRNA (miR-124) in regulating mesodermal cell specification as well as its conserved function during neurogenesis. Our lab uses the sea urchin as a model due to its high fecundity, well-documented gene regulatory networks (GRN), and the fact that it contains a single miR-124, making it a simplified model to incorporate miR-124’s function into the GRN. MiR-124 has been observed in an array of species to directly suppress Notch to promote the neuronal linage. In sea urchin, Notch signaling is important for neurogenesis later in development while its earlier function is to modulate the specification of the mesoderm. We bioinformatically identified one or more potential miR-124 binding sites of Notch, Nodal, Ese (blastocoelar specific transcription factor), and Gcm (pigment cell specific transcription factor). The sea urchin Delta/Notch signaling pathway initiates specification of mesodermally-derived blastocoelar and pigment cells and later Nodal signaling ensures proper segregation of these cells to perform immune functions. We have determined that miR-124 directly suppresses Nodal, Notch, and blastcoelar specific transcription factor Ese to mediate proper specification and development of these immune cells. More recently we aim to reveal the molecular mechanism by which miR-124 impacts neurogenesis. We have observed that when we inhibit miR-124 that there is a significant decrease in mature neurons as well as an overall decrease in levels of serotonin expressing neurons. This decrease in specified neurons in miR-124 knockdown embryos as also resulted in slower-moving larval behavior. Due to our results and literature I predict that miR-124 directly inhibits Notch to mediate neurogenesis. I propose to test this by using a modified oligo designed to flank the binding site of miR-124 identified within Notch. By removing miR-124 suppression of Notch I will be able to determine if this proposed mechanism explains the overall decreased specified neurons in my miR-124 knockdown embryos. Our results have revealed a vital role of miR-124 in mesodermal cell specification, in addition to testing its conserved function in promoting neural differentiation in sea urchin.",Kalin Konrad,"Santiago Suarez, University of Delaware; Jia L.

In addition, providing high school students with research experience can complement classroom learning, and is particularly helpful for underrepresented groups. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the transition to virtual learning that has accompanied it, presents unique challenges as well as opportunities for neuroscience education initiatives. At Columbia University’s Zuckerman Institute, our summer high school internship program, BRAINYAC (Brain Research Apprenticeships in New York at Columbia), was upended this past March by COVID-19, forcing us to migrate our teaching online and to assess the efficacy of the program in a virtual context. While the difficulties of virtual education are clear, virtual learning has also been touted as a solution to making quality education more accessible. As neuroscience researchers and educators, it is essential that we collectively take a critical look at our practices in this moment so we can continue to provide high school students with rigorous and engaging neuroscience curricula. In an interactive talk, we will discuss how we pivoted a hands-on, lab-based program to a purely virtual format that utilized both synchronous virtual teaching and asynchronous resources and projects focused on multimedia science communication, computational skills, and community building. We will also provide a forum for others who facilitate neuroscience education initiatives to share their own experiences.

rec5F4czwpIQKpECC,Distinctive signatures of information seeking during changes of mind in controllable environments,"The ability to flexibly adjust our confidence and change our mind in light of new information is a hallmark of human cognition. Using perceptual decision-making as a model system, previous work has focused on situations in which participants are observers adapting their decisions to incoming evidence. However, in many real-life settings, subjects exert active control over their environment when sampling information for decision-making. Here, we examined how being in control over evidence sampling influenced changes of mind and the associated confidence, as compared to uncontrollable environments. Across five variants of the same experiment (N=113 human participants), we found that changes of mind required more evidence against current beliefs in controllable environments. These changes of mind were also associated with reduced confidence, but were more likely to be confirmed on the next trial. Computational modelling revealed that in controllable environments, more stable beliefs, rather than a reduced sensitivity to evidence explained these differences. At the neurophysiological level, changes of mind in controllable environments were associated with a stronger involvement of a dorsal attentional network in MEG, and were followed by an increased pupil-linked arousal during decision evaluation. Together these findings characterise specific signatures of human information seeking in controllable environments.",Marion Rouault,"Marion Rouault, Department of Cognitive Studies, Ecole Normale Superieure de Paris, France; Aurélien Weiss, Department of Cognitive Studies, Ecole Normale Superieure de Paris, France; Jun Seok Lee, Department of Cognitive Studies, Ecole Normale Superieure de Paris, France; Jules Bouté, Department of Cognitive Studies, Ecole Normale Superieure de Paris, France; Jan Drugowitsch, Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Valérian Chambon, Department of Cognitive Studies, Ecole Normale Superieure de Paris, France; Valentin Wyart, Department of Cognitive Studies, Ecole Normale Superieure de Paris, France",École Normale Supérieure (grid.5607.4),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 22:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 22:15:00+00:00,
rec5JGsg0HQNNPeaC,Temporal expectation of probabilistic rhythms,"The environment surrounding the human brain is full of rhythm and temporal regularities which can be extracted to improve perception and ultimately survival. Many studies have suggested that neural oscillations may be a candidate mechanism for processing and predicting such rhythms particularly in the auditory domain. However, such studies are often limited by a narrowing scope, studying only perfectly isochronous rhythms that are unlikely to be found in the natural world (cf. speech). How might such an oscillatory mechanism behave in a more probabilistic rhythmic environment? We designed a behavioral experiment to study how humans make predictions under these more ambiguous conditions. Participants listen to a train of tones drawn from gaussian distribution around perfect isochrony and report whether the final tone is early or late relative to their expectation. We found that the method for calculation of temporal expectation depends critically on the stimulus rate (from 1 Hz – 4 Hz). We compared our behavioral results with two models of temporal prediction at different levels of explanation: a Wilson-Cowan model of oscillatory behavior from a neural perspective and an ideal observer Bayesian model. Our analysis studies the potential (if any) for oscillatory behavior to be used as a mechanism for a rhythmic prior in the Bayesian sense even under uncertain rhythmic scenarios",Keith Doelling,"M.

rec5PJbw2u2Hhk5Tt," Comparing decision-making across social, emotional, and perceptual tasks","Every day we are making decisions that have associated uncertainty. They range from the perceptual, sensorimotor ones (e.g. grabbing a cup of coffee) to high-level, social ones (should I trust this person?). However, while considerable research has been done within each domain, how the decision-making at the perceptual/sensorimotor level relates to decisions at higher levels is still largely unknown. Furthermore, existing research suggests that, for certain psychiatric disorders, there may be decision-making differences already at a perceptual level (e.g. autism; schizophrenia). However, the extent to which this happens in different conditions and pre-clinical traits is still not well understood. My research combines perceptual, sensorimotor, emotional and social decision-making to better understand the connection (or lack thereof) between these different decision-making levels. In addition, we analyze how decision-making at different levels is affected by psychiatric conditions and personality traits. In our more recent, pre-registered study, we analyzed people’s behavior in a perceptual task (dot-motion), an emotion recognition task (the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, RMET), and a social decision-making task (trust game), in a Midwest community sample (Minnesota State Fair goers, n = 123). We found no correlation between participants' performance across tasks. However, we found a strong positive correlation of decision confidence across tasks: participants more confident in their responses in a perceptual task also tended to be more confident in their responses on the emotion-recognition task and social task. Furthermore, reported confidence across tasks correlated negatively with participant’s alexithymia scores (a subclinical trait characterized by low emotional awareness). Altogether, our results suggest that confidence in one’s decisions is a personality trait that spans different types of decisions, and that it may be related to the degree of emotional awareness one has.

rec5Q2NlIZT8PqMjd,An implantable kinematic headplate for sub-micron skull positioning in mice,"Head immobilization is widely used in neuroscience studies to facilitate sensory stimulus control, behavioral monitoring, and neurophysiological recordings. Head-fixation strategies that combine mechanical stability and repeatable positioning over time or across instruments are particularly important for cellular resolution imaging or manipulation experiments. Headplates using kinematic coupling principles have been developed for precise micron-scale stability and position repeatability in rats (Scott et al. 2013, Rich et al. 2018). Here, we sought to extend this technology to a system small enough to be worn by mice (weighing <2 grams) and capable of submicron registration accuracy. To achieve these goals, we designed a headplate and clamp based on the Maxwell kinematic coupling system. The clamp was an anodized aluminum mount with three vee grooves, oriented at 120 degrees relative to each other. The headplate was a stainless steel triangle with three half spheres at the triangular vertices. Neodymium magnets attached to the clamp were used to provide the clamp force. We assessed the registration accuracy of the system using super resolution two-photon imaging of fluorescent microspheres (1μm diameter) fixed to the headplate following repeated attachments of the headplate. In initial experiments, registration accuracy (root mean square displacement) was 1.35μm in x, 1.42μm in y, and 0.28μm in z. Surgically implanted mice tolerated the headplate well and behaved normally. Scanning electron microscopy of the half spheres revealed mesoscale ridges and grooves in the metal surface. We replaced the stainless steel half spheres with precision ruby spheres. This improved repositioning accuracy to 0.17μm in x, 0.32μm in y, and 0.21μm in z. We anticipate that our system may facilitate experiments in mice where high precision and stability are required, such as imaging experiments using voluntary head restraint, time-lapse developmental studies, and registration of the same subject across multiple instruments.",Su Jin Kim,"Su Jin Kim, Boston University Neurophotonics Center;Benjamin B.

Large-scale simulations using simple point neurons are an important tool for studying and understanding how network dynamics implement neural computations. Given that the EEG is generated by spatially separated transmembrane currents, it cannot be computed directly from point neurons. Here, we asked the question whether a combination of quantities defined in point-neuron network models could accurately approximate the EEG. We evaluated different candidate “EEG proxies”, i.e., firing rates, membrane potentials, synaptic currents, and compared their outputs with the EEG generated when spikes produced by the point-neuron network serve as synaptic input to a population of mutually unconnected multicompartment model neurons with realistic morphologies. We found that a new class of proxies, based on an optimized linear combination of time-shifted AMPA and GABA currents, provided the most accurate estimate of the EEG over a wide range of network states of the point-neuron network. The performance of the new proxies was evaluated under different assumptions about properties of the multicompartment-neuron network, i.e., cell morphologies, distribution of presynaptic inputs and position of the recording electrode. We explored the application of a convolutional neural network (CNN) as an alternative approach to predict the EEG from synaptic currents. The substantial increase in complexity of the CNN provided a minimum improvement of the estimation performance showed by linear proxies. Our results can be used to easily calculate a biologically realistic EEG signal directly from point-neuron simulations and thereby facilitate quantitative comparison between computational models and experimental EEG recordings.",Pablo Martinez Canada,"Pablo Martínez-Cañada, Neural Coding Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy, Neural Computation Laboratory, Center for Neuroscience and Cognitive Systems @UniTn, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Rovereto, Italy and Optical Approaches to Brain Function Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy; Torbjørn V.

rec5vt09AhlSzEmCK,Discrete and continuous dynamics of neural state space during decision making,"Perceptual decision-making tasks involve transforming continuous sensory inputs into discrete decisions and continuous actions (Parr & Friston, 2018). This transformation occurs across a large network of brain areas. In mice performing such a task, neurons encoding choice are localized in forebrain and midbrain regions, while neurons encoding action initiation are distributed across the brain (Steinmetz et al. 2019). Whether the representation of brain-wide neural activity during such a transformation evolves in a continuous or discrete manner remains unclear (VanRullen & Koch, 2003). Hidden Markov models (HMM) can be used to assess neural dynamics when latent neural states are assumed to be discrete. Here, we compare this approach with that describing smooth evolution of states by decoding behavior following either HMM, or independent component analysis (ICA) using data collected by Steinmetz et al (2019).
Discrete state representation via HMM had similar decoding accuracy when decoding visual stimulus (present or not) compared to that obtained via continuous state via ICA. In contrast, continuous representation yielded greater accuracy in decoding action (go vs no-go) compared to discretized state reduction. Across sessions, discretized states mapped onto different behavioral epochs, potentially due to differences in the brain regions sampled, how individual mice approach the task, or between-day variability of a given mouse. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) to refine the discrete state representation in light of this variability. Coupling of neural spiking rate to behavior was used as a proxy for neurons’ contribution to behavior. We use insights from the GLM to refine the comparison of discrete and continuous models for decoding behavior. These results suggest a quick/almost instant change in neural dynamics in response to visual stimulus and a slow changing dynamics, when leading to action.

Meditators demonstrated increased magnitude of differential activation in the dorsal attention vs. default mode network in a sustained attention task, relative to controls.

However, some researchers claim this feeling of richness is an illusion. We developed several tasks to estimate the richness of perceptual experiences based on information theory, in an approach we call the “Massive Report” paradigm. First, we simply showed participants (in lab N=10, in MTurk N>600) a brief glimpse (SOA=67, 133 or 267ms before being masked) of one natural scene picture (we used 580 images in total) and asked for 5 nouns/adjectives/verbs that describe the scene. Second, we compiled a large pool of descriptors for the set of images as potential “alternatives” and performed classical discrimination tasks with confidence ratings. The novelty of the paradigm is that we interrogated the phenomenology associated with a single image with a “massive” set of questions (between 20 and 80640 questions per image).  The results of these experiments suggest that subjects can discriminate a huge repertoire of scene characteristics; in information theoretic terms, the bandwidth of differentiation measures at > 1500 bits per second (compared to previous estimates of <40 bits per second).

Such large-scale recordings potentially allow questions about brain network communication rules between neurons during behavioural tasks to be meaningfully addressed. However, analytic approaches to such datasets are currently lacking. We consider here the expected number of connections that might be recorded between neurons in these brain regions with current technology, to guide what the correct analytic approach to such recordings might be. We consider an ‘inductive’ argument, with multiple neurons in multiple brain regions and a simplified connection mapping between these neurons. Using the hyper-geometric distribution, we derive a probability distribution for the number connections recorded between the neurons of anatomically connected regions. This mathematically derived distribution is validated by Monte Carlo simulations of directed graphs. Our method is applied to simulated graphs with several neurons, based on counts in rat brain regions, and connection matrices from the Blue Brain project’s model of the mouse neocortex connectome. We conclude that the probability of simultaneously recording directly connected pairs of neurons in anatomically connected regions can approach zero, given current recording technology.

rec6D10aSIjfTg2vc,Adult-born Neurons Inhibit Developmentally-born Neurons,"     Recent reports indicate that lateral inhibition plays a powerful role in selecting which dentate gyrus (DG) neurons are recruited during memory formation. This raises the question of whether developmentally-born and adult-born DG neurons have distinct roles for inhibition, particularly in vivo when neuronal ensembles are selected during memory encoding. To address this we combined chemogenetics and immunohistochemistry for BrdU+Fos to silence and measure activity in developmentally and adult-born neurons as rats learned a spatial water maze task. Specifically, retrovirus was injected into the DG of male rats at 6 weeks of age to express the inhibitory DREADD receptor, HM4Di, in neurons born in adulthood. The same rats were also injected with BrdU to label developmentally or adult-born neurons. At 10 weeks of age rats were injected with either the HM4Di agonist CNO or vehicle, then trained in the water maze. We found that silencing a subset of adult-born neurons (aged 4 weeks) increased activity levels in the developmentally-born neuron population. However, silencing adult-born neurons did not affect activation in other adult-born neurons within the DG, suggesting limited interaction amongst the adult-born population. As well, we have examined activation of interneurons (PV+ and SST+) within each treatment group to determine if silencing neurons at different ages impacts downstream activity in inhibitory interneurons. Our recent findings implicate PV+ interneurons in the modulatory subcircuit between neuron populations within the DG.

rec6EoULwRvE0zs9U,Dynamics of history-dependent perceptual judgment,"Perception is not the mere encoding of instantaneous physical features. A main determinant of perceptual choices is the pre-existing state of the subject as shaped by recent events. In other words, perceptual systems exhibit the important feature of being history-dependent. In a recent study (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.199489v1), we focused on the role of stimulus history and its updating dynamics. We trained rats to classify whisker-mediated vibrations according to their mean speed, assigning each stimulus to one of two possible categories, “strong” or “weak”. Rats showed a response bias that was inversely correlated to stimulus values received in the preceding trials, but not dependent on previous choices or rewards. Specifically, receiving a high-speed stimulus led to a lower probability of classifying upcoming stimuli as “strong”, and vice versa, an effect which lasted for several trials. Surprisingly, the repulsive bias in a given trial n, following a stimulus in trial n-1, increased with the time interval between the two. The same key results were obtained by testing human subjects in an analogous tactile discrimination task. We modeled subjects’ perceptual judgments as the result of a history-dependent shift in decision criterion applied to sensory input, outperforming an ideal observer model based on current sensory information only. We also discuss mechanistic hypotheses concerning the neuronal correlates of this phenomenon, that we are currently investigating.",Iacopo Hachen,"Sebastian Reinartz, International School for Advanced Studies; Romain Brasselet, International School for Advanced Studies; Alisea Stroligo, International School for Advanced Studies; Mathew Diamond, International School for Advanced Studies",International School for Advanced Studies (grid.5970.b),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-29 12:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 12:15:00+00:00,
rec6K25PAsAvjJVNL,Intrinsic dynamic landscape of the brain shaped by multiscale structural constraints,"The brain is a complex, nonlinear system, exhibiting ever-evolving patterns of activities even without external inputs or tasks. Such intrinsic dynamics plays key roles in cognitive functions and psychiatric disorders. A challenge is to link the intrinsic dynamics to the underlying structure, given the nonlinearity. Here we use a biophysically constrained, nonlinear-dynamical model to show how the complexity of intrinsic brain dynamics, manifested as its multistability and temporal diversity, can be sculpted by structural properties across scales. At a local level, multistability and temporal diversity can be induced by sufficient recurrent excitatory connectivity and its heterogeneity. At a global level, such functional complexity can also be created by the synergistic interaction between monostable, locally identical regions. Coordination between model brain regions across attractors in the multistable landscape predicts human functional connectivity. Compared to dynamics near a single attractor, cross-attractor coordination better accounts for functional links uncorrelated with structural connectivity. Energy costs of cross-attractor coordination are modulated by both local and global connectivity, and higher in the Default Mode Network. These findings hint that functional connectivity underscores transitions between alternative patterns of activity in the brain---even more than the patterns themselves. This work provides a systematic framework for characterizing intrinsic brain dynamics as a web of cross-attractor transitions and their energy costs. The framework may be used to predict transitions and energy costs associated with experimental or clinical interventions.",Mengsen Zhang,"Manish Saggar, Stanford University;",Stanford University (grid.168010.e),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-30 22:00:00+00:00,2020-10-30 22:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/8HJ42Kg-fTc
rec6KXJNUQuoU4ZiT,Pattern Separation performance and hippocampal neurogenesis in aged female rats,"Aging is associated with impaired performance in behavioral pattern separation (PS) tasks based on similarities in object features and in object location. Hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis plays an important role in PS. In order to evaluate the effect of aging on discrimination of overlapping memories of object location or features, we assessed three groups of Sprague-Dawley rats: Young (Y, 4-5 mo., n=25), Middle-Aged (MA, 18 mo., n=32), and Senile (S, 28 mo., n=13). Spontaneous Location Recognition (SLR) and Spontaneous Object Recognition (SOR) were assessed in the three age groups. The testing chambers for SLR and SOR were black circular and white triangular arenas, respectively. Morphometric analysis revealed a significant age-related reduction in doublecortin (DCX) cell number and diameter in the DG. In the SLR, the discriminatory performance was markedly deteriorated in the MA and S rats as compared with Y rats. In the SOR, S rats presented deterioration in memory disambiguation but MA rats showed a preserved memory as compared with Y rats. Our findings reveal the existence of a significant vulnerability of DCX neurons to age in rats and deficient object location discrimination, likely related to deficient DG neurogenesis. Furthermore, the overlapping memories involving object location are more sensitive to age than overlapping memories involving features. A possible explanation for this observation is that the process of discriminating memories related to features is under the control of another pattern separator node, possibly the Prh, which is less affected by age. Our next goal is to study this region to evaluate the differences between the age groups in it.",Martina Canatelli Mallat,"Priscila Chiavellini, INIBIOLP; Marianne Lehmann, INIBIOLP; Rodolfo G.

rec6Kh9TlvNuAthQw,"What is the nature of representation in the tool-selective areas in the parietal cortex? Effects of category, shape, and spatial frequency","When we perceive an object (e.g., a hammer), much information about the object is processed (e.g., its shape, kind, or function). To what extent such information is processed in the category-selective regions? We have previously shown that tool-selective regions in the occipitotemporal cortex primarily contain categorical information about tools, compared with visual information (e.g., shape or spatial frequency, He et al., 2020). Here we examined the extent these information may be represented in other tool-selective regions, particularly in the parietal cortex. Using fMRI, tool-selective regions in left superior and inferior parietal lobules (SPL/IPL) were defined in a separate localizer with images of animals and tools with naturally variable image statistics. We then tested the nature of representations in these regions with images of animals and tools that were either round or elongated, and either in low or high spatial frequencies (LSF/HSF). Importantly, the images of the two categories shared comparable gist statistics, minimizing low- or mid-level visual differences across the two categories. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), a model of tool category (tools were correlated with each other and not correlated with animals, and animals were not correlated with each other) and a model of HSF were most correlated with the neural patterns in SPL, whereas an interaction model of elongation and HSF was most correlated to the neural patterns in IPL. Functional connectivity analysis further suggested that the tool representation in SPL might be related to the stronger connectivity between tool-selective left medial fusiform gyrus and SPL, compared with IPL, and that the elongation representation in IPL might be related to the stronger connectivity between tool-selective left premotor region and IPL, compared with SPL. Together, these results revealed how different aspects of information are represented in various regions in the tool-selective network to support recognition and potential action planning.

rec6P4ZhSVx22fm96,The inseparability of featural and configural visual processing in dyslexia,"While dyslexia is typically described as a phonological deficit, recent evidence suggests that ventral stream regions, important for visual categorization and object recognition, are hypoactive in dyslexic readers who might accordingly show visual recognition deficits. But what exactly these visual recognition problems are, is still unknown. If dyslexic readers‘ problems are visual, they could be restricted to visual word processing or they might generalize to other visual categories – all or only some, as face recognition is assumed to require domain-specific mechanisms. There are two different approaches to visual recognition; featural and configural processing. Featural processing is generally assumed to be important for word recognition while configural processing is often considered the hallmark of face processing. By manipulating featural and configural information in faces and houses, we investigated whether dyslexic readers are disadvantaged at recognizing certain object classes or utilizing particular visual processing mechanisms. We recruited 34 dyslexic readers and 34 matched typical readers.  Dyslexic readers found it harder to recognize objects (houses), suggesting that visual problems in dyslexia are not completely domain-specific. Mean accuracy for faces was equivalent in the two groups, compatible with domain-specificity in face processing. However, univariate analyses of accuracy miss that even though no overall group differences were found for featural vs. configural accuracy, this does not mean that the tasks were solved using similar representations or the same underlying mechanisms. Representational similarity analysis (RSA), which originates in systems neuroscience, can provide a fuller description of the structure of information representation in each group. RSA on our behavioral data revealed that featural and configural processes were clearly separable in typical readers, while dyslexic readers appeared to rely on a single process. We speculate that reading deficits in some dyslexic readers reflect their reliance on a single process for object recognition.",Bahareh Jozranjbar,"Árni Kristjánsson1, Department of Psychology, University of Iceland; Heida Maria Sigurdardottir, Department of Psychology, University of Iceland",University of Iceland (grid.14013.37),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-26 21:00:00+00:00,2020-10-26 21:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/WEMr0PfPTjY
rec6Rzx8OY7nBw8kf,Disorder- and emotional context-specific neurofunctional alterations during inhibitory  control in generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder,"Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) are highly debilitating and co-morbid disorders. Previous case control studies in either MDD or GAD patients suggest shared emotional and cognitive dysregulations, particularly exaggerated attention to negative information, yet partly separable alterations in cognitive control. However, common and disorder-specific alterations in the interaction between emotion and inhibitory control are poorly understood. 
Method: In order to determine disorder-specific behavioral and neurofunctional alterations in this domain the present study examined emotional context-specific inhibitory control in unmedicated, treatment-naïve, first episode MDD (n = 37) and GAD (n = 35) patients and healthy controls (n = 35) by employing a validated affective go/no-go fMRI paradigm. 
Result: On the behavioral level, we found evidence for supporting the disorder-specific alterations, such that MDD but not GAD patients exhibited impaired inhibitory control irrespective of emotional context (indexed through accuracy rates of no-go trials). On the neural level specifically MDD patients demonstrated attenuated recruitment of a broad bilateral network encompassing inferior/medial parietal and posterior frontal as well as mid-cingulate regions during cognitive control in the negative context (pFWE<.05, whole-brain). Further examination of disorder-specific alterations and potential compensatory recruitment on the neural level revealed that GAD patients exhibited a stronger engagement of the left DLPFC relative to MDD patients and that within the group of GAD patients better cognitive control in negative contexts associated with higher recruitment of this region (pFWE<.05, whole-brain), possibly reflecting a compensatory mechanism on the neural level that facilitates intact performance in GAD. 
Conclusion: Findings from the present study suggest disorder- and emotional context-specific behavioral and neurofunctional deficits in inhibitory control in MDD in negative emotional contexts and may point to a depression-specific neuropathological mechanism. In contrast, GAD patients may maintain intact performance via compensatory recruitment of prefrontal regulatory regions.

rec6UMExBUl56j8Mx,Neural bases of risky decisions involving nicotine vapor vs. monetary reward,"Current studies of addiction involve decision making tasks with money or other non-drug rewards. However, previous research has shown that addiction changes response to drug vs non-drug rewards. Studies using drug reward have not given drugs as an instrumental reward directly in the MRI scanner. In this study, we looked at the neural representations of risk and reward associated with nicotine vs. money. We used a modified e-cigarette to deliver nicotine vapor to subjects with nicotine dependence inside the fMRI scanner. Our novel gambling task orthogonalized the gamble characteristics: variance in outcomes, probability of failure, and the expected value of the outcomes. This allowed us to evaluate their effects separately. The outcome in the case of a nicotine gamble was the duration of nicotine vapor inhalation and in the case of money gamble, it was the amount of money in dollars. We found an effect of greater nicotine reward anticipation in the cingulate gyrus and caudate. Regions in the motor cortex were active during nicotine inhalation, as was expected. The psychophysiological interaction analysis with these motor regions as seeds revealed increased functional connectivity with right middle temporal gyrus during inhalation. We also observed a striking reversal of effects in the cingulate cortex between money and nicotine rewards, in distinct but overlapping clusters. Activation was greater for monetary loss than win, but in contrast, activation was greater when subjects obtained nicotine than when they failed to obtain it. Activities correlating with the variance and probability of loss of a monetary gamble were found in various regions in the frontal cortex and temporal lobe. The results contribute to our knowledge of regions involved in decisions about nicotine when the nicotine reward could be realized immediately and provide insights into the limitations of non-drug rewards in studying addiction.

One way to address this question is to measure the functional influence of individual neurons on each other by perturbing them in vivo. Application of such single-neuron perturbations in mouse visual cortex has recently revealed feature-specific suppression between excitatory neurons, despite the presence of highly specific excitatory connectivity, which was deemed to underlie feature-specific amplification. Here, we studied which connectivity profiles are consistent with these seemingly contradictory observations, by modelling the effect of single-neuron perturbations in large-scale neuronal networks. Our numerical simulations and mathematical analysis revealed that, contrary to the prima facie assumption, neither inhibition-dominance nor broad inhibition alone were sufficient to explain the experimental findings; instead, strong and functionally specific excitatory-inhibitory connectivity was necessary, consistent with recent findings in the primary visual cortex of rodents. Such networks had a higher capacity to encode and decode natural images in turn, which was accompanied by the emergence of response gain nonlinearities at the population level.

rec6Zay7mFfAN01w4,Sensitivity versus criterion mechanisms underlying the attentional blink,"Attention enables us to select behaviorally relevant, stimuli for enhanced sensory processing and decision-making. We investigate neural mechanisms of the “attentional blink”: the impaired ability to select the second (T2) of two targets, when it occurs within close temporal proximity (200-500 ms) of the first (T1). 

Does attentional blink affect the selection of T2 for enhanced sensory processing (sensitivity, d’), for decision-making (criterion, c) or both? Specifically, does it affect d’ and c associated with detecting T2, with discriminating its features, or both? We addressed all of these questions using a single, novel psychophysical task with concomitant EEG (electroencephalography) recordings in 23 human participants. 

Two target stimuli (Gabor gratings) embedded in a stream of plaid distractors appeared in a 10-Hz rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. On each trial, subjects discriminated the orientation of a T1 stimulus (cardinal/diagonal) with a 2-AFC (two-alternative forced-choice) response. They also indicated the presence, as well as the orientation of a T2 stimulus with a 3-AFC response (clockwise/counterclockwise of vertical, or absent). We developed a novel, multidimensional signal detection model to analyze subjects’ multialternative behavioral choices; the model quantified d’ and c for both detection and discrimination of T2 stimuli. 

Significant reductions in both detection and discrimination d’ parameters were observed during the blink. On the other hand, the blink produced virtually no effect on either detection or discrimination criteria. Event-related potentials, including the visual P2 over occipital electrodes and P3b over parietal electrodes modulated in amplitude in a manner that closely resembled detection d’ changes. 

Our study introduces a novel task and framework to investigate behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying the attentional blink, and suggests that selection deficits associated with attentional blink may reflect d’ rather than criterion mechanisms.",Swagata Halder,"Dr.Sridharan Devarajan, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore",Indian Institute of Science Bangalore (grid.34980.36),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 17:00:00+00:00,2020-10-30 17:15:00+00:00,

mediated by a sensation-action loop. We report on replicating two experiments based on two different
models of the locomotion neural circuits of C. elegans [1, 2].

Both articles present point-neuron models that consider the graded nature of the electrical activity
in C. elegans, as opposed to spiking-neuron models—yet both are different. In the first case a
non-dimensional model is used for a small subnetwork in which the values of free parameters are
found by applying constraints with a genetic algorithm. The second model is based on physiological
parameters for cells and synapses, therefore no optimization is needed and almost the complete
connectome of C. elegans is simulated—279 out of 302 neurons. The replications are performed in the
simulating platform Brian 2, which is available as a Python module and is different from the
original methods used.

We were able to verify the main hypothesis proposed by each article. In the first case, the
production of intrinsic network oscillations by central pattern generators (CPGs) along the ventral
nerve cord of the worm. In the second, the existence of a bifurcation in the model state-space
produced by a constant sensory input that creates oscillatory behaviour. Nevertheless, we were
unable to replicate exact quantitative results for the first model, and obtained contradictory
results when performing neural ablations on the second network model. The source code generated, and
data used are made publicly available in code repositories [3].

Although numerous studies tried to clarify a mechanistic explanation of generation and modulation of brain rhythms, yet many aspects are not still well-known. In this computational study, we simulated a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons which generates rhythmic activities in a range of slow oscillations (1-20 Hz) as well as a faster oscillation in the range (30-100 Hz). We verified a noticeable correlation between synaptic decay time constant and amplitude-frequency correlation in cycle-by-cycle population activity. Our results showed that the greater the difference of time decay of inhibitory synapses compared to that of excitatory synapses, the stronger the amplitude-frequency correlation of population activity. We also observed a change in the correlation sign of the phase of slower oscillation with the amplitude of faster oscillation depending on the difference between the decay time of excitatory synapses compared to inhibitory synapses. These results indicate that the difference between the decay time of excitatory and inhibitory synapses plays an important role in tuning of oscillatory activity of the cortical circuits.

simultaneously controlling the large number of muscles and joints in the human body. Although modular
organization has been confirmed in the hindlimb control system of several animal species, it has yet to be
established in the forelimb motor system or in primates. Expanding upon experiments originally
performed in the frog lumbar spinal cord, we examined whether co-stimulation of two sites in the
macaque monkey cervical spinal cord results in motor activity that is a simple linear sum of the responses
evoked by stimulating each site individually. Similar to previous observations in the frog and rodent
hindlimb, our analysis revealed that in most cases (77% of all pairs), the directions of the force fields
elicited by co-stimulation were highly similar to those predicted by the simple linear sum of those elicited
by stimulating each site individually. A comparable simple summation of EMG output, especially in the
proximal muscles, suggested that this linear summation of force field direction was produced by a spinal
neural mechanism whereby the forelimb motor output recruited by co-stimulation was also summed
linearly. We further found that the force field magnitudes exhibited supra-linear (amplified) summation,
which was also observed in the EMG output of distal forelimb muscles, implying a novel feature of
primate forelimb control. Overall, our observations support the idea that complex movements in the

rec6y1ZCspsPMGRcp,A spatial developmental generative model of human brain structural connectivity,"The complex wiring of the human connectome is thought to support integrated brain function and adaptive behaviour. Yet the mechanisms leading to the emergence of this connectome topology are unknown. Generative network models have begun to shed light on these mechanisms by showing that stochastic wiring rules, subject to simple constraints based on a trade-off between the wiring cost and putative functional value of a connection, can reproduce many key topological features of empirical connectome data. However, recent evidence suggest that they may not accurately capture the way in which these properties are spatially embedded. One potential reason for this limitation is that current models assume a fixed geometry based on the adult brain, ignoring the major changes in shape and size that occur early in development, when connections form. Here, we propose a new generative network model that proposes a new cost-value trade-off formulation, and which can readily incorporate developmental changes in brain geometry, informed by structural MRIs obtained from a public database of foetal scans acquired from 21–38 weeks gestational age. Using a cross-validated procedure to fit these models to connectomes generated from 100 healthy adults with diffusion MRI, we show that our new model more accurately reproduces the topological properties of empirical data than existing models, but that developmental changes in brain shape and size do not lead to major gains in model fit. Critically, none of the models accurately capture the spatial embedding of network topology, being unable to reproduce the observed spatial topography of hubs. Our results suggest that generative models based on stochastic wiring rules can capture statistical properties of brain networks, but that they may be insufficient to comprehensively explain the way in which these properties are spatially embedded.",Stuart Oldham,"Ben Fulcher, The University of Sydney; Kevin Aquino, Monash University; Aurina Arnatkevičiūtė, Monash University; Rosita Shishegar, Monash University; Alex Fornito, Monash University",Monash University (grid.1002.3),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-27 01:00:00+00:00,2020-10-27 01:15:00+00:00,
rec76Cgrh0pLYazFL,Neurocorrelates of Free Will Revisited,"
Neither science nor neuroscience explain free will. Some research shows humans have no free will, that it may be an illusion, [1], while other identifies networks of brain areas, including the pre-supplementary motor area, the anterior prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex, that underlie voluntary action and cause distinctive conscious experience of intending to act and then controlling one's own actions, concluding that volition consists of a series of decisions regarding whether to act, what action to perform and when to perform it [2]
New findings identify networks of brain areas, including the pre-supplementary motor area, the anterior prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex, that underlie voluntary action. These areas generate information for forthcoming actions, and also cause the distinctive conscious experience of intending to act and then controlling one's own actions.
The peak of evolution of human consciousness manifests at psychological and behavioural level with the ability to exercise conscious actions with less conditioning, particularly in the form of control over one's thoughts and emotions,
Such evolution of consciousness  can be observed within certain network dynamics and could even visibly manifests in the morphology of the cortex, 

The ability to make choices according to values and intents, and the awareness that animal instincts are determined by mechanical and biological responses to external stimuli, is what distinguishes human behaviour, develops awareness, consciousness and possibly drives evolution. This research  revisits historical hypotheses based on recent findings, and proposes a novel interpretation of  recent findings A theory of consciousness and free will as factors impacting consciousness and evolution is formulated.

rec76iRFG0eBQtdXV,Serotonin functions as a bidirectional guidance cue regulating growth cone motility,"The neurotransmitter serotonin is implicated in a range of mental health disorders that are associated with altered neuronal connectivity during development. Remarkably, serotonin is synthesized and secreted in the embryonic brain prior to the formation of most synapses, thus before neural circuits become fully functional. This suggests serotonin could regulate neuronal connectivity through a process known as axon guidance, which enables neurons to form accurate connections. Growth cones, the leading tips of neurons, are guided in the developing brain by instructive molecules called guidance cues that enable neurons to reach and connect to their targets. We hypothesized that serotonin acts as a novel guidance cue, regulating growth cone motility and hence, axon guidance during early stages of brain circuit formation. Using a growth cone motility assay and a range of pharmacological tools, we found serotonin acts bimodally, attracting and repelling growth cones, through the binding to specific serotonin receptors 5HT2a and 5HT1b, respectively. Using high resolution imaging of growth cones exposed to microgradients of serotonin, we showed serotonin-induced bidirectional motility is underpinned by two distinct signalling mechanisms: 5-HT2a-induced attraction is mediated by calcium release, while 5-HT1b-induced repulsion is driven by cAMP signalling. Optogenetic manipulation of 5-HT2a signalling altered growth cone trajectories away from serotonin, further demonstrating the specificity of secreted serotonin as an axon guidance cue.

rec7AtegJc4CT2yKq,Translating time from temporal variation in transcription and structure in humans and chimpanzees,"How the unique capacities of human cognition arose in evolution is a question of enduring interest. It is still unclear which developmental programs are responsible for the emergence of the human brain. The inability to determine corresponding ages between humans and apes has hampered progress in detecting developmental programs leading to the emergence of the human brain. I harness temporal variation in anatomical, behavioral, and transcriptional variation to determine corresponding ages from fetal to postnatal development and aging, between humans and chimpanzees. This multi-dimensional approach results in 137 corresponding time points across the lifespan, from embryonic day 44 to ~55 years of age, in humans and their equivalent ages in chimpanzees. I used these data to test whether developmental programs, such as the timeline of prefrontal cortex maturation, previously claimed to differ between humans and chimpanzees, do so once variation in developmental schedules is controlled for. I compared the maturation of frontal cortex projections from structural magnetic resonance (MR) scans and from temporal variation in the expression of genes used to track long-range projecting neurons (i.e., supragranular-enirhced genes) in chimpanzees and humans. Contrary to what has been suggested, the timetable of prefrontal cortex maturation is not unusually extended in humans. This dataset, which is the largest with which to determine corresponding ages across humans and chimpanzees, provides a rigorous approach to control for variation in developmental schedules and to identify developmental programs responsible for unique features of the human brain.

rec7OY8omLI6yQQAS,"The dynamics of body category and emotion processing in high-level visual, prefrontal and parietal cortex. ","Recent studies provided an increasingly detailed understanding of how visual objects like faces or bodies are categorized. What is less clear is how attributes like the emotional expression are represented, whether the coding of the expression is influenced by the task and influences the category representation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate methods, we measured BOLD responses while participants viewed whole body expressions and performed an explicit (emotion) and implicit (shape) recognition task. Our results show that the type of task can be decoded in extrastriate body area (EBA), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) with higher activity for the explicit task condition in the first two areas and no evidence of emotion specificity processes in any of them. During the task of explicit recognition of the body expression, category representation would be strengthened while action related information would be suppressed. These results provide evidence that body representations in high level visual cortex and frontoparietal cortex are task sensitive and differentially contribute to expression representation based on their different anatomical connectivity.

rec7RiK7OUOxe2eoQ,Pitfalls in quantifying exploration in reward-based motor learning,"Movements are variable. It is unclear how much different variability sources contribute to this variability and how these contributions can be quantified. These questions are especially of interest in studying reward-based motor learning, where people are thought to add exploratory variability to their inevitable motor noise to discover which movements lead to reward. Whether variability promotes or hampers learning is however controversial. To clarify this relation between variability and learning, it is important to separate variability caused by exploration from motor noise. 

We developed the additional trial-to-trial change (ATTC) method for quantifying exploration as the additive variability following non-rewarded movements over variability following rewarded movements. Here, we aimed to validate the ATTC method by simulating learning using existing models of reward-based motor learning. This is important because we developed the method in a random reward paradigm, in which participants cannot use the feedback to improve their performance. Furthermore, learning contributes to trial-to-trial changes in behavior in a systematic, rather than random, manner, and may hence influence the quantification of exploration. We calculated the similarity between input exploration and exploration estimated from model behavior, for four models and their parameters.

The fairly simple rationale behind the ATTC method is that exploration is higher following reward absence, which is a key feature of all models, too. Nevertheless, similarity is sensitive to the ratio of input motor noise and exploration, and exploration is generally underestimated.

Our results reveal two important pitfalls in quantifying exploration based on trial-to-trial changes. Firstly, performance-dependent reward causes considerable correlations in samples of motor noise, thereby affecting estimates of exploration depending on the ratio of the learners’ exploration and motor noise. Secondly, using trial-to-trial changes to quantify exploration results in an underestimation of exploration since the exploration relative to which the change is calculated is unstable.

rec7ZJdYHmnlhuoqI,Examining the relationship between externalizing and internalizing behaviour and the cortico-amygdalar network in children with neurodevelopmental disorders: A multi-modal dimensional study  ,"Purpose: Children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) exhibit high rates of externalizing and internalizing behaviours. These behaviours have been linked to variation in cortico-amygdalar circuitry in typically developing children (TDC). Here, we examine whether cortico-amygdalar variation relates to internalizing and externalizing behaviours in children with different NDDs.
Methods: Using data from the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Disorder (POND) Network, we analyzed T1 weighted, resting state fMRI and diffusion weighted data from a transdiagnostic sample of children and youth (ages 6-18 years, n=157-346) with a primary diagnosis of ASD, ADHD, or OCD, and TDC. Cross-sectional behavioral assessments from the parent-report Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) and multi-modal imaging were used. Associations between externalizing or internalizing behavior and cortico-amygdalar network connectivity indices (i.e. structural covariance, functional connectivity white matter connectivity) were examined using linear regressions, controlling for age, gender, and modality specific covariates. 
Results: No significant associations (or diagnostic group-by-behavior interaction effects) were found between externalizing or internalizing behavior and any of the connectivity indices examined.
Conclusions: The null results of the current study do not provide evidence of a shared relationship between cortico-amygdalar network connectivity properties and externalizing or internalizing behavior across a transdiagnostic sample of children and youth. Using larger sample sizes, comprehensive behavioral batteries, and shifting the theoretical framework for examining brain-behavior relationships in transdiagnostic samples may be necessary for delineating such relationships.

rec7oHoU7zBy5lR1l,Grip-specific dynamics are not shared between action and observation in the frontoparietal cortical grasping network,"Neurons in the frontoparietal cortical grasping network respond during both the execution and observation of action. This observation has been used to support numerous theories linking motor control and cognition but remains poorly understood at the population level. To address this, we use chronic multi-electrode arrays to record simultaneously from neuronal populations in the macaque primary motor (M1), premotor (F5), and posterior parietal (AIP) cortices as animals either grasp a variety of different objects or observe a human subject doing the same. We find a surprising lack of functional neuronal classes in any of these cortical areas: Instead, neurons in each area span a unimodal spectrum of sensitivities to observed action, with some neurons in F5 and AIP even preferentially active during observation. The lack of clear neuron classes suggests the link between action and observation may indeed be better understood in the framework of neural manifolds. Using demixed principal component analysis (dPCA), we find evidence for dimensions of neural activity shared between action and observation contexts, which decrease in prominence from AIP to F5 to M1. However, this activity does not include a shared representation of grip type, suggesting a lack of common representation of the specific details of the observed action. Linear classifiers confirm the lack of congruent grip representation across all dimensions of neural activity. Finally, we show that dynamical system models of the data fail to offer a unified explanation of the disparate representations of grip types across action and observation contexts. Activity during observation therefore lacks the precise grip-specific representations and dynamics seen during movement. This may reflect a non-specific mental rehearsal of movement that specifically avoids grip-potent neural dimensions to avoid making unwanted movements.",James Goodman,"James Goodman, DPZ; Stefan Schaffelhofer, DPZ, cortEXplore; Hansjörg Scherberger, DPZ, University of Göttingen",German Primate Center (grid.418215.b),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-27 18:00:00+00:00,2020-10-27 18:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/8S1F-fsPEvA
rec7pIoZ7nvlqVIKi,Bilateral stimulus-locked responses in upper-limb muscles during visually-guided reaches,"In dynamic environments, humans often perform visually-guided actions at very short latencies. During a reach to a novel visual stimulus, the fast visuomotor system mediates the first wave of muscle recruitment. The stimulus-locked response (SLR) is a transient burst of muscle recruitment occurring approximately 100 ms after the appearance of a novel visual stimulus requiring an immediate reach. The SLR has been demonstrated in the upper-limb muscle of the reaching arm and is hypothesized to be mediated by the tecto-reticulo-spinal tract. While a growing body of literature suggests involvement of the superior colliculus in SLR generation, the contribution of the reticulo-spinal tract has not yet been investigated. Previous research has shown that the reticulo-spinal tract projects bilaterally to upper-limb muscles, thus we predict the SLR will be present bilaterally regardless of which arm completes the reach. In the current study, participants (n = 15) completed a modified emerging target paradigm, they were instructed to use either arm to quickly intercept a moving target as it emerged from behind an occluder in one of seven possible locations. Surface electromyography was used to record activity from the pectoralis major, an upper-limb muscle involved in reaching, bilaterally as participants performed the task. A psychometric function generated based on arm choice demonstrated that participants typically chose to reach with the arm closest to the target and identified the target location with approximately 50% of reaches from each hand. Within muscle comparisons at this location revealed robust SLRs regardless of whether the ipsilateral or contralateral arm was chosen. Further, between muscles, the SLR was found bilaterally. Our results are consistent with SLR transmission via the reticulo-spinal tract.

rec7qppcLXiIXqBV5,When differences matter: rTMS/fMRI reveals how differences in dispositional empathy translate to distinct neural underpinnings of self-other distinction in empathy ,"Self-Other distinction is crucial for empathy, since it prevents the confusion of self-experienced emotions with those of others. We aimed to extend our understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms of self-other distinction. Thirty-one female participants underwent continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) targeting the supramarginal gyrus (rSMG), a sub-region of the temporoparietal junction previously shown to be involved in self-other distinction, and the vertex, a cortical control site. Right after stimulation they completed a visuo-tactile empathy task in an MRI scanner. Self-Other distinction performance was assessed by differences in emotion judgments and brain activity between conditions differing in the requirement for self-other distinction. Effects of rSMG-cTBS (compared to vertex cTBS) on self-other distinction depended on dispositional empathic understanding: It decreased self-other distinction in participants with lower dispositional empathic understanding but increased it in participants with higher empathic understanding. On the neural level, this inverse relationship between disposition and self-other distinction performance translated into a reduction or an increase of cTBS-induced rSMG activity, in persons with lower and higher dispositional empathy, respectively. Moreover, the distinct activations of rSMG activity were associated with two anatomically and functionally distinct networks. These findings open up novel perspectives on the causal role of rSMG in self-other distinction and empathy.

rec7sj9PIF3OO3Tze,Neural encoding of phonemes modulated by linguistic information,"Speech perception entails the mapping of the acoustic waveform to linguistic representations. For this acousto-linguistic transformation to succeed, the speech signal needs to be tracked over various temporal windows ranging from phonemes (tens of milliseconds) to sentences (seconds). Using a sound quilting algorithm (Overath et al., 2015) to control the temporal extent of speech structure, we recently showed that an acoustic analysis of temporal speech structure occurs in superior temporal sulcus (STS), while left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is engaged in mapping temporal speech structure to linguistic representations (Overath & Paik, under review).
Here, we provide novel evidence that the neural encoding of a fundamental linguistic unit (phoneme) is modulated by both the acoustic and linguistic contexts using accelerated fMRI (TR = 1.2 s). Ten native English speakers without knowledge of Korean listened to 33-s long speech sounds (either phoneme-quilted speech, or natural speech) in native (English) or foreign (Korean) languages. A linearized encoding analysis was performed using ridge regression with finite-impulse response models. The performance of various models either encoding certain conditions/predictors or not was compared in terms of Pearson correlation coefficient. Group-level statistical inference used a cluster-based permutation test.
Durations of phoneme classes (linguistic features) in addition to envelope (acoustic features) improved the prediction of BOLD signal in the Heschl’s gyrus (HG), planum temporale (PT), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), bilaterally (cluster-p = 0.001). Critically, encoding language (English or Korean) or manipulation of speech (quilted or natural) improved the prediction of BOLD signal in the left STS from the anterior to the posterior (cluster-p < 0.007).
These findings demonstrate that the information of rapid speech sounds embedded in the sluggish BOLD signal can be reliably extracted using linear regression. Furthermore, they suggest that acousto-linguistic transformation is modulated by linguistic processing.

rec7x74cknaYCpsBT,Application of human kinematic parameters for measuring motion performance in mice,"In the field of human rehabilitation and neural repair, gross motor function is characterized by changes in kinematic parameters that measure the difficulty/smoothness of a motion. While kinematic parameters such as peaks and jerk are well established in assessing motor efficiency in humans and non-human primate models, they have not been validated in rodent models. Traditionally, motor function in mice is qualitatively assessed by observation and there is a need for a standard to quantify motor function. Validation of these parameters for analyzing motor function would provide a new perspective for quantitating individual variation in motor learning and execution for mouse models of motor related disorders. We sought to answer if these known kinematic parameters in humans could predict individual variation in motor efficiency in mice during the single pellet-grasping assay. Mice were food restricted to increase motivation to reach for a high reward food pellet and were recorded for 10 minutes a day for 4 days while attempting to retrieve the pellet. Individual reaches were manually tracked using Tracker Motion Analysis Software to extract time position data to derive peaks and jerk. Peaks of failed reaches decreased significantly with progressive training and were comparable to peaks of successful reaches, suggesting that peaks may be a predictive measure of motion efficiency in mice. Jerk may not be a sensitive enough measure to quantify motor performance in mice during the single pellet-grasping assay. The observation that the number of peaks decreases with motor training is consistent with previous studies in humans. Thus, peaks serve as a quantitative measure for studying learning and execution of fine motor skills in mice.",Michael Mykins,"Michael Mykins1, Department of Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996; Billy Lau1, Department of Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996; Eric Espinoza-Wade2, Department of Mechanical Engineering, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407; Keerthi Krishnan1, Department of Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996",University of Tennessee at Knoxville (grid.411461.7),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 18:00:00+00:00,2020-10-30 18:15:00+00:00,
rec81MQJgDpAZcF92,Role of long-range inhibitory neurons in cortical circuits ,"Background: Cortical activity is highly dependent on behavioral state of an animal with different states, such as sleep and wake, having profound impact on cognition and cortical processing. Despite its importance, the circuitry responsible for sensing behavioral state and modifying cortical states remains unknown. However, recent work suggests inhibitory neurons (INs) are likely involved in this regulation. While most inhibitory neurons are locally projecting, there is an IN subtype, defined by the co-expression of somatostatin (SST) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), that arborizes densely over large cortical areas. Here, we test the hypothesis that SST/nNOS cells play a crucial role in the generation of low frequency oscillations, a hallmark of multiple cortical states. 

Results: Using a state-of-the-art set of intersectional genetic tools, we perform a variety of characterizations of SST/nNOS cells, to examine their afferent and efferent connectivity. We fluorescently label SST/nNOS cell processes using a membrane bound fluorophore to characterize output arborizations.  We found that SST/nNOS cells have dense local connectivity and long-range projections in ipsi- and contralateral cortex. We also examine inputs to SST/nNOS cells utilizing monosynaptic rabies tracing finding rich local input from excitatory and inhibitory cells. 
We compliment these experiments with in vivo extracellular electrophysiology paired with optogenetic manipulation of SST/nNOS cells in order to causally test the role of SST/nNOS cells towards network activity. Excitation of these cells preferentially induces low frequency oscillations while optogenetic inhibition specifically suppresses 1-3Hz oscillations. Similarly to endogenous oscillations, induced low frequency oscillations coincide with decreased gamma power, increased single unit phase locking to 1-3 Hz oscillations, and a current source density laminar profile characteristic of endogenous low frequency oscillations. 

Conclusion: Together this set of experiments strongly suggest a role for SST/nNOS cells in the regulation of physiological low frequency oscillations across large cortical areas though the precise spatial scale is unknown.

Methods: Ninety-five healthy participants were tested in a within-subject design. In counterbalanced order, ambient light was blocked during sleep with an eye mask for one week during the summer months (experimental condition) or not-blocked (control condition). After five habituation nights, participants were tested on three cognitive tasks: word pairs memory, Psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), and motor-skill learning (MSL) on two consecutive days. Overnight consolidation was also examined on word pairs and MSL. 
On the last testing days of both weeks, participant wore a wearable EEG devise in order to measure sleep architecture. 
Results: Our analysis revealed superior word pairs encoding in the blocked light condition (p= 0.024). We also found faster performance on the second day of PVT in the blocked light condition (p= 0.002). The eye mask didn’t provide a better performance on MSL (Blocked-light: p< 0.001 vs. No blocked-light: p< 0.001) or overnight consolidation of word pairs (p=0.363). 
The blocking light exposure increased the percentage of time spent in NREM stage 2 (p=0.023) and REM sleep (p=0.025). 
Conclusion: We conclude that wearing an eye mask during the summer do not only contributes to optimize learning ability and vigilance, but also provides beneficial effect in terms on sleep quality and sleep architecture. No effect was found on motor performance on a finger-tapping task.

Rats were randomly assigned to either single- or paired-housing, then five weeks later they were tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and a modified version of the novelty-induced suppression of feeding test (NFST). Seven days later, their brains were harvested and processed for OT-labelling. Pair-housed rats displayed moderately higher open-arm exploration in the EPM and took significantly less time to initiate consumption of the snack in the NSFT. Furthermore, compared to single-housed rats, pair-housed rats had significantly more OT-ir cells in the ventral part of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The number of OT cells in the ventral PVN correlated negatively with their latencies to begin consuming the snack on Day 1 of the NSFT. Overall, these findings suggest that “social buffering” is mediated, at least in part, by social contact-induced remodelling of the OT system.

Auditory and visual inputs can modulate the perception of the complementary modality, but the neural correlates of audiovisual integration are not fully understood. In the visual cortex, auditory stimuli modulate light-evoked firing rates of individual neurons. Here, we investigated how auditory stimuli modulate other aspects of neural processing in addition to firing rate, and whether this results in improved neural encoding of the visual stimulus. We presented visual drifting gratings with and without simultaneous auditory white noise to awake mice while recording neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). Sound modulated the light-evoked activity of 70% of light-responsive neurons, the majority of which increased their activity in association with sound. These firing rate changes were accompanied by increased response duration and reduced response latency. Additionally, across contrast levels sound reduced the trial to trial variability of the light-evoked response. In individual neurons that were additionally direction-selective, we found that sound improved the discriminability of the preferred direction over all other directions. Furthermore, sound improved the neural population’s encoding of the drifting grating direction, especially at low to intermediate contrast levels. These results demonstrate that simultaneous auditory input enhances the light-evoked response magnitude and timing and decreases variability in individual neurons, resulting in improved stimulus encoding at the individual neuron and population level.

Sex differences in segregation of the auditory, ventral attention and frontal-parietal networks were present in young adulthood, suggesting inherent differences. Two key brain networks that support high-order cognition, the default mode and frontal-parietal, showed significant age-related loss of segregation from midlife, well before older age. Females showed significantly lower segregation in the frontal-parietal network than males in midlife. The salience network showed sex differences in older adults; again, females had significantly heavier loss of segregation relative to males. The heavier loss of segregation in females from midlife and continuing into older age, in brain networks key for high-order cognition, may provide an avenue for understanding the higher risk load and incidence of age-related neurodegenerative disorders in females relative to males.",Feng Deng,"Feng Deng, Trinity College Dublin; Erika Steward, Trinity College Dublin; Lorina Naci, Trinity College Dublin",Trinity College Dublin,"Theme A: Development, Neurodegenerative Disorders and Injury",Interactive talk,2020-10-27 10:00:00+00:00,2020-10-27 10:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/YB0MUbihBI0

rec8ZmCChWybVg7cS,Oxytocin and embryonic diapause,"We have examined prenatal oxytocin receptor expression in the mouse embryo, detecting the oxytocin receptor as early as embryonic day four, during the blastocyst stage. This is the developmental stage where blastocysts begin implantation into the uterine endothelium, an event critical for successful pregnancy. Interestingly, rodents- like most if not all mammals- undergo a phenomenon called diapause, in which the timeframe that the embryo implants is delayed during a maternal state unfavorable for pregnancy, such as while nursing a previous litter (Fenelon et al., 2014). Embryonic diapause is thought to occur by making the uterus non-receptive to implantation in a manner regulated by the hypothalamic neuroendocrine axis, but the underlying mechanism is unknown (Renfree and Shaw, 2000). Lactation requires the neuropeptide oxytocin, raising circulating levels of oxytocin that can permeate down to the embryo, perhaps via maternal-fetal signaling (Stouffer and Hennebold, 2014). 

We hypothesize that oxytocin, released in response to the sensory stimulus of a suckling pup, might act to initiate diapause in mice. In support of this, we have recapitulated a developmental delay in vitro using a cell culture model of blastocyst implantation (Bedzhov et al., 2014), in which the time for mouse blastocysts to implant is delayed by 12 hours in the presence of oxytocin, as compared to saline-treated blastocysts (p-value:0.0087). Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we have elucidated that oxytocin may be functioning to signal entry into diapause within the embryo by reducing the overall conductance of the mouse blastocyst to initiate developmental pausing until conditions are favorable for pregnancy progression. 

In addition to examining diapause in vitro, we are using chemo- and opto- genetics to activate oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamus of mothers in the absence of the nursing to ask if oxytocin release is sufficient for diapause induction. Furthering our understanding of the uterine conditions favorable for allowing blastocyst implantation and the mechanisms by which the mouse blastocyst integrates cues from its surroundings to dictate developmental timelines has major implications for neuroendocrine signaling, developmental biology, and reproductive medicine.

rec8cljTT7pMUPdPq,The classification system of hand motor-imagery EEG signals ,"The classification system of hand motor-imagery EEG signals is generally used in intelligent rehabilitation robots for hand movement disorders caused by nerve injury during stroke. The intelligent rehabilitation device based on the brain-computer interface can effectively activate the damaged brain area from the perspective of rehabilitation medicine and improve the rehabilitation effect of the patient.  However, due to the inherent differences between human brain signals, and the fact that most middle-aged and elderly patients suffer from imagination decline, the actual effect of most classification systems is poorer than expected, which limits the effectiveness of rehabilitation training.
The hand motor-imagery EEG signal classification system designed and implemented in this paper proposes a method to solve this personalized difference problem. Research details are as followed: 1) This paper studies and verifies the algorithm of signal preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. A set of methods with superior performance are applied to the system implementation; 2) A feature selection method based on classification effect is designed. This method is only based on the selection of channel and frequency features, which can effectively improve the generalization ability of the classification system; 3)  The characteristics and classification effects of the data collected from different rehabilitation patterns are compared, and a combination of two rehabilitation patterns is applied to the classification system.
This system can achieve 88.4028% accuracy in 5×5 folds cross-validation on self-collected data.

rec8gunHWkRjZif6D,The different mechanisms that distinguish motor skill acquisition from adaptation,"As people move within an environment, changes in circumstances may lead to movement errors. To produce correct movements, these errors must be processed regardless of whether people are acquiring a new motor skill (de novo learning) or adapting a well-known movement (motor adaptation). However, these two types of learning should develop differently and switching between response mappings in de novo learning should not lead to reach aftereffects typically observed after adaptation. Here, we conducted two experiments that differentiate de novo learning from adaptation and explore the mechanisms of de novo learning further. In experiment 1 (N = 16), we distinguished the two motor learning types by having each participant train with two perturbations in counterbalanced order: a 30-degree visuomotor rotation and a reversal of cursor feedback in the opposite direction of a mirror axis. Importantly, we matched the movements required to reach the targets in both tasks. We found no order effects, suggesting that learning for one perturbation does not affect the other. Although participants countered for both perturbations by the end of only 90 training trials, learning for the rotation task was more gradual while variability in learning was greater for the mirror task. Participants generally took longer to initiate and execute reaching movements in the mirror task. Moreover, participants only exhibited reach aftereffects after completing the rotation task. In experiment 2 (N = 116), we developed an online version of the mirror task, with target locations placed farther from the mirror axis than in experiment 1. Asymptotic learning of participants differed depending on target location, but reach aftereffects were also not observed. These results highlight the development of de novo learning and how it is distinct from adaptation. As such, our future work will investigate both behavioural and neural processes underlying these different types of motor learning.",Raphael Gastrock,"Bernard Marius 't Hart, York University; Denise Y.

rec8ilulRRaaY1ND6,DystoniaNet: A Deep Learning Platform to Diagnose Dystonia from Raw Structural MRI,"Dystonia is a neurological disorder of heterogeneous pathophysiology, which causes involuntary muscle contractions leading to abnormal movements and postures. As the third most common movement disorder after essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, its diagnosis is remarkably challenging due to the absence of a biomarker or ""gold standard"" diagnostic test. This leads to a low agreement between clinicians, with up to 50% of cases being misdiagnosed and diagnostic delays extending up to 10.1 years. We developed a deep-learning algorithmic platform, DystoniaNet, to automatically identify and validate a microstructural neural network biomarker for dystonia diagnosis from raw structural brain MRIs of 612 subjects, including 392 patients with three different forms of isolated focal dystonia and 220 healthy controls. DystoniaNet was specifically designed to estimate its uncertainty and refer uncertain cases to further examination. Moreover, its streamlined architecture makes it more computationally efficient than other popular deep learning platform, such as AlexNet. In our dataset, DystoniaNet identified clusters in corpus callosum, anterior and posterior thalamic radiations, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and inferior temporal and superior orbital gyri as the biomarker components. These regions are known to contribute to abnormal inter-hemispheric information transfer, sensorimotor processing, and executive control of motor commands in dystonia pathophysiology. DystoniaNet used this biomarker to achieve an overall accuracy of 98.8% in diagnosing dystonia, referring only 3.5% of cases to further examination. The diagnostic decision by DystoniaNet was computed in 0.36 s per subject. DystoniaNet significantly outperformed shallow machine-learning algorithms in benchmark comparisons, showing nearly a 20% increase in its diagnostic performance. The DystoniaNet platform showed substantial improvement over the current 34% agreement rate on dystonia diagnosis between clinicians. In summary, DystoniaNet leverages deep learning to deliver highly accurate, timely, interpretable, and generalizable dystonia diagnosis, hence contributing to enhance clinical decision-making of this disorder.",Davide Valeriani,Kristina Simonyan,Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (grid.39479.30),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 13:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 13:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/nY0XGUfYAWk
rec8lB5HEFKCJX2qq,Chaotic dynamics in a spatially distributed network generate population-wide shared variability,"Neural activity in the cortex is highly variable in response to an identical stimulus. This variability is correlated among different neurons and has been found to be low dimensional. Cortical population recordings have also shown that shared variability decreases with the distance between a pair of neurons. Previously, Huang et al. demonstrated that spatiotemporal dynamics in spiking neural networks can give a rise to population-wide shared variability. In this work, we show that the population-wide shared variability can be internally generated in deterministic recurrent networks with chaotic rate dynamics. We analyzed the dynamical regimes of recurrent networks with excitatory and inhibitory populations, which are spatially distributed on a ring or a torus. We found that the networks have dynamical regimes of different regular solutions, depending on the temporal and spatial scales of inhibition, such as static bumps, bulk oscillations, traveling waves and alternating bumps. In particular, in a parameter regime where the excitatory projection width is close to the inhibitory projection width, the networks exhibit chaotic rate dynamics. The chaotic solutions contain low-frequency power in rate variability and have low-dimensional and distance-dependent correlations, in agreement with experimental findings. Further, we found that the parameter regime of chaos becomes larger when the networks are driven by correlated noisy inputs. The chaotic regime expands as the variance of the correlated noise component increases, while being insensitive to the variance of the independent noise components.

rec8uA2vEQLRSfyaI,This is built to last:  Delta and Theta changes in resting-state EEG activity after regulating emotions,"Over the past years, EEG has been used to characterize cortical responses associated with emotion regulation. One limitation of the previous experiments is that they focused on task-related activity, without exploring the possibility that regulating emotions can leave a trace in the brain, by affecting its oscillatory activity at rest. The relevance of this point is to understand whether the effect of regulation lasts and alters brain activity, or it vanishes soon after the application. 
33 volunteers took part in the study. Five minutes of electrical brain activity at rest were recorded before and after 1) one session in which participants perceived and regulated (through distancing) their emotions (Regulation session, ReS) and 2) another session in which they only perceived emotions (Attend session, AtS). The order of the two sessions was randomized. We used 160 visual stimuli, both neutral and negative, taken from the International Affective Picture System to elicit emotions. Subjective ratings of valence and arousal of stimuli were also recorded using the Self-Assessment Manikin procedure, as a manipulation check of effective regulation.
Behavioral results showed the efficacy of the regulation strategy, with significant differences in the arousal and valence ratings, respectively reduced and increased in the ReS compared to the AtS. Cluster-based permutation analysis on EEG data at rest revealed a significant increase in delta and theta activity after ReS compared to the AtS. These findings suggest that regulating emotions affects baseline activity of the brain. Specifically, distancing produces increased activity in delta and theta frequencies after the regulation session. In line with previous findings, we argue that an increase in these frequencies may be considered as a signature of emotion regulation processes.",Gaia Lapomarda,"Stefania Valer, University of Trento; Remo Job, University of Trento; Alessandro Grecucci, University of Trento",University of Trento (grid.11696.39),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 09:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 09:30:00+00:00,
rec8uJCELzVu23MnQ,Bi-directional tDCS produces anterior and posterior current flow in neighbouring cortical targets.,"Introduction. Motor- and sensory-evoked potentials (MEPs and SEPs) are well-established biomarkers of the physiological effects of tDCS, and the primary motor (M1) and sensory (S1) cortices are positioned in close proximity on either bank of the central sulcus. De- or hyper-polarisation of neurons by tDCS is dependent on the orientation of current flow. 

Conventional tDCS montages produce unidirectional current flow across M1 and S1. Since the principal axes of pyramidal neurons in the pre- and post-central gyral walls are predominantly oriented in opposite directions, conventional montages could produce orthogonal effects. Given the intimate connectivity between M1 and S1, this may contribute to variability in tDCS outcomes, and adds complexity to interpretation of observed biomarker changes. 

Informed by current flow models, we propose a novel, bi-directional tDCS montage whereby current is directed to flow predominantly in the same direction along pyramidal neurons in M1 and S1, and therefore in opposite directions with respect to the whole head. 

Objectives. To model a bi-directional tDCS montage which produces posterior-anterior (PA) current flow through M1 (PAM1) and anterior-posterior (AP) current flow through S1 (APS1). An ongoing physiological study will compare M1/S1 excitability changes after application of bi-directional and conventional tDCS.

Materials & Methods. E-field intensity and direction are modelled in MRI scans from the Human Connectome Project using Realistic Volumetric Approach to Simulate Transcranial Electric Stimulation (ROAST) and Freesurfer software. 

Results. A custom HD-tDCS montage can produce uniformly polarizing current in M1 and S1. However, bi-directional current flow is achieved at the cost of E-field intensity at cortical targets. A conventional montage achieves desired E-field intensity at the cost of direction. 

Summary and Outlook. Bi-directional tDCS can be achieved in neighbouring cortical regions. Model optimisation and physiological validation is ongoing, to improve E-field intensity and quantify the effects of bi-directional tDCS on cortical excitability.",Jenny Lee,"Jenny Lee, Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London; Carys Evans, Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London; Nick Ward, Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London; Sven Bestmann, 1Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging.",University College London,"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-28 12:15:00+00:00,2020-10-28 12:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/NlTCrh_TQ78
rec8xLgbFXth86YUh,Gender (im)balance in citation practices in cognitive neuroscience,"It has recently been reported that in five broad-scope neuroscience journals, citation rates for papers first- and/or last-authored by women are lower than would be expected if gender was not a factor in citation choices (Dworkin et al., 2020). Given the important implications that such underrepresentation may have on the careers of women researchers, it is important to determine whether this same trend is true in subdisciplines of the field, where interventions might be more targeted. Here, we report the results of an extension of the analyses carried out by Dworkin et al. (2020) to citation patterns in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (JoCN). Specifically, we asked whether the degree to which the categorical authorship-gender balance of articles cited in JoCN from 2009-2020 reflected the gender balance of the journal’s authorship during that time frame. First, we determined that the gender balance of JoCN authorship was stable during the time frame considered, with women-led authorship (i.e., with a woman in the first and/or last author position (“W∪W”)) considerably more prevalent in JoCN compared to the five broad-scope neuroscience journals considered previously (59.2% W∪W at JoCN vs. 46.7% W∪W at the “Big 5”). Next, we determined that the reference sections of papers published in JoCN during this time span included W∪W papers at a level considerably lower than the 59.2% that would be expected if gender were not a factor in making citation choices. Furthermore, this pattern of citation imbalances is characteristic of the reference sections in all author-gender groups (i.e., “MM,” “MW,” “WM,” and “WW”), thereby implicating systemic factors.

Patients with traumatic brain injury are at risk of developing hyperexcitability. Our study is aimed at exploring new ways to mitigate the effects of the brain damage. The results show that pyruvate and tempol application can alleviate the symptoms in rat models.
To evaluate the influence of the treatment we measured local field potential in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in rats exposed to brain injury and performed a set of behavioural tests.
Pyruvate and tempol administered orally during the first days after the injury are shown to significantly reduce neurological malfunctions and slightly lessen sensory-motor impairment. Tempol also improves exploratory behaviour and lowers the level of anxiety in rats with injury.

rec95jgsRZN1urU87,"The Effects of Partial Connection Symmetry and Antisymmetry on Dynamic Stability, Lyapunov Spectra, and Training of Recurrent Neural Networks","Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are used to model how the brain achieves characteristics of neural dynamics that are necessary for computation and reliable behavior, such as stability, timescale, and geometry of network activity. Often, RNN models are initialized with random connectivity, but the effects of constraining connectivity with biologically observed synaptic statistics are not well understood. Here we study how partial symmetry and antisymmetry of the network’s weight matrix shapes trainability and stability of dynamics. Networks with partially symmetric weight matrices have reciprocal synapses that are correlated in strength. To assess the stability of the dynamics, we calculate the full Lyapunov spectrum that quantifies the exponential sensitivity to small perturbations along a neural trajectory. Increasing symmetry decreases the number and magnitude of positive Lyapunov exponents, indicating increased dynamic stability. We also observe that more symmetric networks have lower dimensional spontaneous activity as determined by both principal component analysis and Kaplan-Yorke dimension. Consistent with previous work, partially symmetric networks also exhibited dynamics on longer time scales, as determined by the decay rate of the autocorrelation. By contrast, partial antisymmetry resulted in decreased stability, decreased activity dimensionality, and shortened autocorrelation timescales compared to random networks. Furthermore, we train networks with different levels of initial symmetry to autonomously generate simple periodic signals. For different networks, we vary both the symmetry of the initial weight matrix and the level of self-coupling, which causes single units to positively reinforce their own activity. When self-coupling is strong, networks with greater antisymmetry generate target periodic signals at a higher success rate. These results may explain how features of connectivity in biological neural networks affect the stability and shape the geometry of their activity.",Matthew Ding,"Rainer Engelken, Columbia University;",Columbia University (grid.21729.3f),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-28 17:30:00+00:00,2020-10-28 17:45:00+00:00,
rec99u84vIikZM6WC,Computational principles of motor adaptation,"Animals, including humans, have a remarkable ability to adapt movements to changing external conditions. Despite advances in understanding motor adaptation at the behavioural level, disentangling the underlying neural mechanisms remains challenging. Dorsal premotor (PMd) and primary motor (M1) cortex are the main cortical areas involved in movement planning and execution, and neural activity changes within these two areas are believed to underlie motor adaptation. However, it remains unknown whether changes in neural activity emerge due to synaptic changes within the motor cortices or through altered inputs to them. As there are currently no experimental methods to directly measure synaptic strength in vivo, answering this question must rely on indirect evidence from neural recordings, obtained through correlation or more sophisticated inference analyses. Yet, the extent to which synaptic changes can be detected with these measures remains unclear. We used a new approach to investigate the role of synaptic changes in PMd and M1 for motor adaptation. Instead of trying to infer weight changes from experimental data, lacking ground truth knowledge, we implemented a recurrent neural network architecture that solved motor adaptation tasks through changing its connectivity. This allowed us to 1) measure task-related connectivity changes, 2) compare ground truth weight changes to the results of common inference methods and 3) compare resulting activity changes to experimental data. Using this approach, we found that two commonly studied motor adaptation paradigms – force-field adaptation and visuo-motor rotation – require only small changes in network activity and underlying connectivity to counteract the perturbations. Furthermore, matching experimental observations, the correlation structure among network units was highly preserved, which is usually interpreted as stable synaptic connectivity. Thus, experimentally observed activity changes in PMd and M1 during motor adaptation could potentially arise from small, but effective, synaptic weight changes in PMd and M1.

Although high quality mentoring is an important predictor of persistence for scholars pursuing STEMM careers and can influence the confidence of historically underrepresented trainees' ability to thrive, mentors typically do not receive significant training on how to optimize their mentoring relationships. In this interactive workshop for mentors, we will engage in group discussions around a case study addressing cultural diversity and inclusion and will encourage mentors to share how they might approach the case study and share how they have worked to build trust. Furthermore, stories from student mentees from historically underrepresented backgrounds will be shared to learn from their perspectives.

rec9OWrYVY7iGoDAw,Neural data to visual masking in humans shows that deeper convolutional neural networks capture recurrent processes,"Recent studies have argued for a need to incorporate recurrent processing in the architecture of feedforward models (van Bergen and Kriegeskorte 2020; Kietzmann et al. 2019). Recurrent processing is a crucial feature in human visual processing that supports perceptual grouping (Roelfsema 2006), figure-ground segmentation (Supèr et al. 2001) and recognition under challenging conditions  (Tang and Kreiman 2017; Spoerer et al. 2017; Rajaei et al. 2019). All of this suggests that current feedforward models are limited compared to their recurrence cousins. In this paper, we show how existing feedforward models exhibit operations similar to recurrent processing in the brain. Sixty-two human subjects and a family of ResNet models completed an object recognition task. The models varied in depth - ResNet-6, 10, 18, 34 - with their names indicating the number of layers. We found that the deeper networks (i.e. ResNet-34) performed more similarly to humans under normal circumstances; whereas, shallower networks perform more similarly to humans when recurrent processing is interfered with visual masking. By examining the human subjects’ electroencephalography (EEG) activity and activations in artificial networks, we observed two important findings. One, early differentiation in EEG signals is largely explained by image background and not object category. Image background, image complexity and object category interact: identical objects embedded in more complex backgrounds take longer to reach categorical perception. Two, ResNet models differ in how well they can explain neural data when recurrent processing is unhindered: deeper networks explain more variance as compared to shallower networks. But when recurrent processing is interfered, all networks explain the same amount of variance. Crucially, the difference in explained variance between unmasked and masked data only emerges at ~186ms - a latency beyond feedforward processes. This shows that networks of different depths differ in their abilities to model recurrent processing, showing that deeper networks model capture recurrent processing in humans.

rec9P1WV1AWX9ZKJT,Body silhouettes as features in visual search: evidence from spatially-global attention modulation in visual cortex ,"Visual search for objects in cluttered scenes is guided by top-down attention, allowing observers to efficiently select goal-relevant information from incoming visual input. When search is for low-level features, such as orientation, color, or motion direction, this attentional selection modulates visual processing across the visual field, even at spatially-unattended and task-irrelevant locations. Recent behavioral and neuroimaging studies have provided evidence that similar spatially-global selection mechanisms may exist for highly-familiar object categories such as faces. Similar to low-level features, faces are selectively represented in the visual system. In the present fMRI study, we reveal spatially-global modulation for another selectively-represented object category: human bodies. Participants were cued to search for one of six object categories in two vertically-aligned images. Crucially, two additional, horizontally-aligned, images were simultaneously presented but were never task-relevant across three experimental sessions. Analyses locked to the objects presented in these task-irrelevant images revealed that responses evoked by body silhouettes were strongly modulated by the participants’ top-down attentional set, becoming more body-selective when participants searched for bodies in the task-relevant images. These effects were observed both in univariate analyses of body-selective cortex and in multivariate analyses of high-level visual cortex. Finally, we found that this modulation reflected response gain rather than a generic bias induced by the cues. These findings provide evidence for a spatially-global selection mechanism for human bodies, linking this modulation to body-selective representations in high-level visual cortex.",Sushrut Thorat,"Marius V.

rec9Q2fhvlhicHFCA,Distinct Cluster of Dopaminergic Input Neurons is necessary to establish larval aversive memory,"The ability to learn from past events and apply them to future situations can determine life and death of an organism. In 1985, Tully and Quinn showed that even an inconspicuous organism such as adult Drosophila is able to learn situational information and develop memory. Since then, much has been done in this field and Drosophila has been established as a generally valid model organism for learning and memory. In particular, the Drosophila larva offers unexpected advantages: firstly, the availability and robustness of the larvae for behavioral experiments; secondly, the anatomical simplicity of the larval central nervous system, which consists of only about 10,000 neurons; furthermore, the almost unlimited variety of genetic tools which make it possible to activate or silence individual neurons.  All advantages - together with the latest publication of the connectome – make the larva a popular object of choice in neurogenetics. Above all, the insect mushroom body (MB) is a central unit when it comes to sensory input, processing, and behavioral output. It has been shown that the MB consists of eleven compartments, all of which have a limited number of specific neuronal inputs (MBINs) and outputs (MBONs) - these MBINs can be either dopaminergic (DAN), octopaminergic (OAN), or of unknown identity. Here, we analyzed different mushroom body input neurons to test their significance in salt-dependent aversive classical olfactory conditioning by using the Split-GAL4-UAS system to ablate MBINs at cellular resolution. Our results reveal that an aversive salt-dependent memory is not formed by a single input neuron, rather by an integral network of input neurons in the vertical lobe of the mushroom body.

rec9UfiSPv11F7waH,"Evaluating mechanisms of selective attention using a large-scale spiking visual system model: performance, processing and representational changes","Spatial attention enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of visual information and improves perceptual sensitivity. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of selective attention are still contested: while some theories suggest an enhancement of the signal’s gain, others advocate for a reduction of noise. Comparing these two alternatives with computational models is often complicated by a lack of behaviour (performance, reaction times) or a missing link to neural measures (firing rates, population coding). Furthermore, it often remains unclear whether the proposed mechanisms can implement attentional selection in a model with complex sensory input and noisy processing. Here, we compare different attention mechanisms in a spiking Deep Convolutional Neural Network (sDCNN) performing a visual search task in complex real-world images with spatial cues. With this network, we can directly contrast effects of noise suppression (precision) and two different gain modulation mechanisms on model predictions. Like biological neurons, our sDCNN units have non-linear activation functions, which permits implementation of attentional gain either on a unit's input or on its outgoing connection. By virtue of communicating with spikes, our sDCNNs also face internal noise enabling us to implement a noise-based mechanism, termed precision. Across a variety of measures, such as performance, detection times and firing rates, we show that modulating the unit’s outgoing connection is most effective in selectively enhancing information processing by redistributing activity. For instance, models with gain-based mechanisms become faster at detecting a target object with a valid cue and slower with an invalid cue. In contrast, modulating precision did not produce reliable changes in performance. Leveraging representational similarity analysis, we show that gain mechanisms introduced additional target-related information based on the spatial cue. Our results mirror empirical findings and show that it is possible to adjudicate between attention mechanisms and to estimate their computational efficacy using more biologically realistic models and natural stimuli.",Lynn Sörensen,"Lynn K.

Building on momentum that had been growing over the previous several decades, the BRAIN initiative cast a spotlight on the potential for neurotechnology to address some of society's greatest medical challenges, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, and many other brain diseases. The neural engineering community has responded forcefully to this call, creating several exciting new technologies that offer new important new capabilities for monitoring and regulating neural signaling throughout the nervous system. Some of these new technologies are now being transitioned into commercial products, which is a crucial step toward fulfilling the BRAIN vision. This panel includes four innovation leaders that are working to bring novel and potentially breakthrough neurotechnologies to the clinical market.

rec9dhfFjaHfQFUiR,Recognition memory for highly similar visual stimuli: when novelty is not new,"Novelty in cognitive neuroscience is often taken for granted: anything that the researcher describes as novel should elicit similar neurocognitive responses in the participants. For example, novel stimuli are expected to elicit neural activation in the hippocampus and are also expected to be recognized with a higher probability in a memory test. The experimental results however reveal a more complex picture. It seems that not all novel stimuli are processed in the same manner by the human brain, instead the difference of a stimulus from already seen stimuli determines the neurocognitive responses ascribed to novelty. It follows from this idea, that the more different a stimulus is from a given set of stimuli, the more likely it is to be recognized later. We aimed to test this hypothesis with a unique task, in which the participants are first familiarized with patterned visual stimuli. Next, they have to distinguish these familiar items from similar novel stimuli, and finally their memory is tested for the familiar and novel stimuli alike. The stimuli are algorithmically generated, and the degree of difference across the stimuli is controlled and quantified. Our results show that the more different a stimulus is from the familiars the more likely it is that a participant correctly recognized it, while highly similar stimuli were often confused with the familiars. This result supports the idea that novelty as a category is not necessarily meaningful in cognitive psychological experiments, instead the difference from other stimuli, or unexpectedness should be assessed. This is in line with the basic idea of predictive coding that unexpected information should be prioritized in neurocognitive processing. Our results thus support the idea that predictive coding is universally utilized in the brain, as memory systems also seem to employ this information processing strategy.",Richárd Reichardt,Bertalan Polner; Péter Simor,Budapest University of Technology and Economics (grid.6759.d),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 09:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 09:30:00+00:00,
rec9eugkLILCGtoFW,Symbolic methods for neural dynamics and emergent network behavior in a swim CPG,"We present an approach based on the symbolic dynamics of voltage wave forms and parametric sweeps to study complex behaviors arising in models of individual neurons and rhythmic neural circuits. This method is employed for the bottom up reconstruction of a 4-cell circuit, modeled after the swim central pattern generator (CPG) of the sea slug Dendronotus Iris. We model the circuit under variations of intrinsic cell properties and external parameters that can be controlled in neurophysiological experiments, starting from individual cells and ascending upwards to pairs of half center oscillators, all the way up to the fully connected 4-cell circuit with multiple inhibitory, excitatory and electrical synapses. We analyze diverse activity types in isolated neurons such as tonic spiking, quiescence, or intrinsic bursting, and determine their bifurcation boundaries. We show how chaotic behavior can arise near activity transitions. Using an extended encoding scheme for coupled neurons, we demonstrate emergent network phenomena that can not be  readily inferred from individual neuron properties. We demonstrate how a half-center oscillator (HCO), composed of two mutually inhibiting neurons, can produce anti-phase bursting oscillations, even when individual cells are not intrinsic bursters, as is seen through experimental neurophysiology. Through detailed parametric sweeps, we find appropriate model parameters to replicate experimentally determined CPG behavior, temporal characteristics and emergent 4-cell network bursting, where neither the individual cells nor the HCO pairs can themselves sustain bursting, without the synergistic interactions of excitation, inhibition and electric coupling in the full swim CPG circuit.",Krishna Pusuluri,"Huiwen Ju, Georgia State University; Andrey Shilnikov, Georgia State University",Emory University (grid.189967.8),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-27 21:00:00+00:00,2020-10-27 21:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/i7WPxwc7S7s
rec9zCechwZTkAVAG,Age-related Differences in Visual-Vestibular Integration over Time of Exposure in VR Simulated Driving Environments,"Vestibular function is known to change with age, but the effects of these changes on functional behaviours requiring self-motion perception is largely unknown. Driving is a complex task that involves the use of vestibular inputs to guide self-motion perception and behaviours. However, the degree to which age-related changes in vestibular function affect driving performance has yet to be studied in an experimental setting. Driving simulators are an increasingly common tool for examining driving performance in a safe and controlled way, yet they differ widely in fidelity, including their motion capabilities. Using Toronto Rehabilitation Institute’s high-fidelity, full motion driving simulator, we measured the driving performance of older and younger drivers across three different physical motion conditions: no motion, rotational motion (yaw), and full motion (yaw, pitch, roll, and translational motion) using a between-subjects design (age x motion condition). We tested 34 younger adults aged 18 – 35 and 32 older adults aged 65+ using three, 15-minute driving scenarios for each motion condition. Driving performance was measured across 14 variables (e.g. speed variability, lane deviation). We hypothesized an additive and beneficial effect of motion (no motion to yaw, yaw to full motion) on driving performance (e.g. reduced speed variability, reduced lane deviations), with older adults benefiting more from additional motion components than younger adults. Our preliminary results demonstrate a more nuanced effect of motion, with older adults demonstrating a larger benefit from the addition of both yaw and full motion on driving performance, despite driving more poorly than younger adults overall. Furthermore, older adults demonstrated greater improvements in performance over drives than did younger adults. These findings suggest that age-related differences in how different motion types affect driving performance should not be viewed in terms of decrements in function, rather in unique perceptual and cognitive strategies in integrating multisensory information.",Robert Nowosielski,"Robert J.

recA0XEicb06QGrZI,BrainGlobe: a Python ecosystem for computational (neuro)anatomy,"Neuroscientists routinely perform experiments aimed at recording or manipulating neural activity, uncovering physiological processes underlying brain function or elucidating aspects of brain anatomy. Understanding how the brain generates behaviour ultimately depends on merging the results of these experiments into a unified picture of brain anatomy and function. We present BrainGlobe, a new initiative aimed at developing common Python tools for computational neuroanatomy, and its core package, the BrainGlobe atlas API (BG-AtlasAPI).
While digital high-resolution 3d atlases have been produced for several model organisms, the effective use of these atlases depends on the availability of an application programming interface (API) that enables researchers to develop software to access and query atlas data. Some atlases come with an API, but these are generally specific for individual atlases, and this hinders the development and adoption of open-source neuroanatomy software. BG-AtlasAPI overcomes this problem by providing a minimal Python interface to download and interact with atlases for the most common model organisms in systems neuroscience. BG-AtlasAPI is a small and extensible package that allows developers to develop software agnostic to the atlas and species, increasing adoption and interoperability of packages in neuroscience. 
Finally, we showcase the usage of BG-AtlasAPI in other Python projects (for cell detection, atlas registration and visualisation) developed within the BrainGlobe ecosystem, to illustrate how it provides easy interoperability and support for brain atlases from different species.

recAHYBTbitMrBZ15,Remembering what happened when: Emergence and stability of context-specific hippocampal sequences encoding odors and time,"How does the brain keep track of events we need to remember as well as the intervals between them? A recent model of hippocampal function posits that hippocampal networks generate spiking sequences to encode important sensory stimuli (external world) and place or time between them (internal representations) forming memory maps of spatiotemporally related experiences. But does it use one or multiple encoding strategies to combine external and internal representations? Do sensory and time representations share the same stability adaptability or learning-dynamics? Using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo in CA1 of head-fixed mice, we tracked the activity of thousands of cells across days, while mice learned and performed an olfactory delayed non-match-to-sample task requiring working memory. We observed ‘odor-cells’, encoding specific olfactory stimuli, followed by ‘time-cells’ encoding delay timepoints after a specific odor. Despite forming continuous spiking sequences, the two neuronal groups exhibited strikingly different properties. Odor-cells retained stable fields when the delay or odor presentation was extended as well as across days, whereas time fields were highly unstable and readily remapped in both cases. During learning, the number of odor-cells remained fixed while time-cells increased as performance improved. This increase was learning-related since it did not occur in naïve mice passively exposed to the same task trials. Finally, cells did not spike randomly before they acquired their field or after they lost it. A cell’s activity progressively converged to its field and then diverged from it over days. Odor-cells acquired a stable field earlier and for longer than time-cells. Therefore, the hippocampus can generate and sustain both stable representations of external cues as well as flexible temporal-codes with distinct learning-dynamics. This crucial combination of stability and flexibility allows hippocampal circuits to link fixed elements of the external world despite their changing temporal relationships, to construct memory-maps of related experiences.",Jiannis Taxidis,"Jiannis Taxidis, UCLA; Peyman Golshani, UCLA",David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA (grid.471398.0),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 17:00:00+00:00,2020-10-30 17:15:00+00:00,
recAK7JeAgOzwG4gJ,Bayesian inference of population prevalence,"Within neuroscience, psychology and neuroimaging, the most frequently used statistical approach is null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) of the population mean. An alternative approach is to perform NHST within individual participants and then infer, from the proportion of participants showing an effect, the prevalence of that effect in the population. We propose a novel Bayesian method to estimate such population prevalence that offers several advantages over population mean NHST. This method provides a population-level inference that is currently missing from study designs with small participant numbers, such as in traditional psychophysics and in precision imaging. It delivers a quantitative estimate with associated uncertainty instead of reducing an experiment to a binary inference on a population mean. Bayesian prevalence is widely applicable to a broad range of studies in neuroscience, psychology and neuroimaging. Its emphasis on detecting effects within individual participants could also help address replicability issues in these fields. ",Robin Ince,"Jim W. Kay, University of Glasgow; Philippe G.

How do these apparently divergent signals converge? We developed a signal detection task to study the neural convergence and divergence of interoceptive and somatosensory signals. Participants focused on either cardiac or tactile events and reported their presence or absence. Beyond some evidence of divergence, we observed a robust overlap in the pattern of activation evoked across both conditions in frontal areas including the insular cortex, as well as parietal and occipital areas, and for both attention and detection of these signals. Psycho-physiological interaction analysis revealed that right insular cortex connectivity was modulated by the conscious detection of cardiac compared to somatosensory sensations, with greater connectivity to occipito-parietal regions when attending to cardiac signals. Our findings speak in favour of the inherent convergence of bodily-related signals and move beyond the apparent antagonism between exteroception and interoception. ",Aleksandra Herman,"Clare E.

recAPPIQ0KhoUfNyX,A Double-Layer Multi-Resolution Classification Model for Decoding Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Spikes,"To study how information are encoded in neural signals, we build a double-layer multi-resolution classification model for decoding specific behavior information from single-trial spatio-temporal patterns of spikes. The model can take hippocampal spiking activities as input signals and memory-related variables as output signals. In the first layer, to avoid overfitting caused by small sample size and the very high dimensional input and output signals, L1-regularized b-spline logistic regression classifiers are used to reduce dimensionality and yield sparse model estimation. A wide range of temporal resolutions of neural signals are included by using multiple classifiers with different numbers of b-spline knots. Each classifier serves a base-learner to classify spatio-temporal patterns with a given temporal resolution. A bootstrap aggregating strategy is used to further reduce estimation variances of these classifiers. In the second layer, another L1-regularized logistic classifier takes outputs of first-layer classifiers as inputs to generate the final output prediction. This classifier serves as a meta-learner that combines multiple temporal resolutions to classify the spatio-temporal patterns of spikes. We test the proposed decoding modeling method with both synthetic data and experimental data recorded from rats and human subjects performing memory-dependent behavioral tasks. Results show that this method can effectively avoid overfitting and yield accurate prediction of memory labels. The double-layer multi-resolution classifier consistently outperforms the best single-layer single-resolution classifier by extracting and utilizing multi-resolution spatio-temporal features of spike patterns in classification. The proposed model can be used not only to predict memory contents, but also has the potential to be used to design optimal spatio-temporal patterns for eliciting specific memories in the hippocampus, and thus have important implications to the development of hippocampal memory prostheses.",Xiwei She,Dong Song; Theodore Berger,University of Southern California (grid.42505.36),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-29 20:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 20:15:00+00:00,

This information-rich representation has the potential to transform our understanding of the relationship between patterns in brain connectivity and neurological processes, disorders, and diseases. However, existing computational techniques used to analyze connectomes are often insufficient for interrogating multi-subject connectomics datasets. Several methods are either solely designed to analyze single connectomes, or leverage heuristic graph invariants that ignore the complete topology of connections between brain regions. To enable more rigorous comparative connectomics analysis, we introduce robust and interpretable statistical methods motivated by recent theoretical advances in random graph models. These methods enable simultaneous analysis of multiple connectomes across different scales of network topology, facilitating the discovery of hierarchical brain structures that vary in relation with phenotypic profiles. We validated these methods through extensive simulation studies, as well as synthetic and real-data experiments. Using a set of high-resolution connectomes obtained from genetically distinct mouse strains (including the BTBR mouse — a standard model of autism — and three behavioral wild-types), we show that these methods uncover valuable latent information in multi-subject connectomics data and yield novel insights into the connective correlates of neurological phenotypes.",Vivek Gopalakrishnan (he/him/his),"Vivek Gopalakrishnan, JHU;  Jaewon Chung, JHU;  Eric Bridgeford, JHU; Jesús Arroyo, JHU; Benjamin D.

recARebtLPL6W0qFg,Myelination of parvalbumin interneurons shapes the function of cortical sensory inhibitory circuits and mouse whisker-mediated behaviour ,"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) represent the only non-neuronal cells that receive bona fide synapses from neurons. In the developing somatosensory cortex, we previously showed that OPCs are highly innervated by fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons (Orduz et al., 2015, eLife; Orduz*, Benamer* et al., 2019, Nat Commun). Interestingly, the PV interneuron subtype represents the largest proportion of myelinated GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex. Despite several studies on neuron-OPC synapses, the function of these synapses remains poorly understood. In a recent work, we genetically inactivated γ2-mediated GABAergic synaptic signaling of OPCs to disturb PV interneuron-OPC synapses. We found that PV interneuron-OPC synapses does not highly affect OPC proliferation, oligodendrocyte differentiation and the developmental myelination pattern of the somatosensory cortex (Balia et al., 2017, Glia). Nonetheless, it has remained unclear whether neuron-OPC synapses could guide the correct myelination of the presynaptic neuron, impacting its function in neuronal circuits. 
Here, we demonstrate that the disruption of GABAergic synaptic signaling of OPCs prior to myelination onset resulted in severe PV interneuron myelination defects characterized by longer internodes and nodes and proximal axon malformation. Consequently, high-frequency PV interneuron discharges as well as PV interneuron-dependent postsynaptic latencies and strengths of excitatory neurons were reduced during postnatal cortical development. These dysfunctions generated a strong excitation-inhibition imbalance that was correlated with whisker-dependent texture discrimination impairments. We concluded that, during cortical development, the inactivation of γ2-mediated OPC synapses have profound consequences in the myelination of PV interneurons, affecting the function of mature cortical inhibitory circuits. Our data reveal that PV interneuron-OPC synaptic activity during postnatal development constitute a key step in the construction of cortical circuits involved in rapid and strong inhibition during sensory processing (Benamer et al., 2020, Nat Commun, In Press).

recAWMtcIQTgjEM5I,Recognition of Harmonic Sound Sequences Investigated By Behavioral And Electrophysiological Studies,"Consonance rating when listening to the two consecutively or simultaneously presented sounds is associated with the ratio of their fundamental frequencies. The simpler ratio is perceived as more consonant. Most of the previous studies investigated the neural mechanism of the harmony perception of simultaneously presented complex tones and emphasized the role of auditory system in subcortical level. However, there is still little known about harmony perception of sequentially presented pure tones and its relation to the short-term memory. Earlier studies which investigated the role of harmonic intervals on recognition performance mostly compared tonal and atonal melodies in Western music with both musicians and nonmusicians, and the results were contradictory (Dewar et al., 1977; Krumhansl, 1979; Schulze et al., 2011;  Schulze et al., 2012). In those studies, melodies that were compared had different notes and contours. In this study, two melodies that consist of the same 10 tones were generated. Melodies had the same contour but differed order of tones, forming different harmonic relations between consecutive tones. Non-musician participants were asked to choose which melody (harmonic or inharmonic) was more consonant. The results showed that even though the ratings for in/harmonic melodies were not significantly different, it was easier for them to notice the same amount of frequency change in one note of the harmonic melody. An EEG experiment was conducted to test the working memory load hypothesis. The sustained anterior negativity (SAN) was compared as a measure of working memory load but amplitude of SAN did not reveal a significant difference. However, nonmatching stimulus elicited a P3b signal with higher amplitude for the harmonic condition. This result suggests that a higher level expectation occurs for harmonic condition since all the other parameters that affect P3b signal were well controlled in the experiment.

recAXNYYR3E3Njh4o,The role of delayed maturation of GABA-A receptor function in schizophrenia,"Unlike positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, cognitive abnormalities of this disorder are manifested very early and are present in the prodromal period in preadolescent children. An imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory transmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) unrelated to synaptic pruning may underlie this preadolescent manifestation of cognitive deficits. In the normal brain, GABA binding to GABA-A receptors causes depolarization during early development then becomes hyperpolarizing owing to the changes in KCC2 and NKCC1 expression and function. Interestingly, premature ablation of the subplate (SP) layer of the developing visual cortex resulted in delayed upregulation of KCC2 causing a continued depolarizing effect of GABA in the cerebral cortex. Our laboratory described that neonatal ablation of the SP layer of the PFC in rat results in multiple behavioral and neuropathological abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia. In order to study the effects of a delayed GABA functional switch on cognitive function and PFC pathology of schizophrenia, we sought to ablate the SP layer of the developing PFC in postnatal day 1-old rats. Lesioned and sham-operated pups were sacrificed at different time points between P5 and 3 months, and coronal sections through the PFC were processed for immunohistochemical labeling of GAD67, parvalbumin, KCC2, and NKCC1.

However, superficial regions are exposed to higher magnitude but unmodulated sine waveform with a steady amplitude. The mechanisms through which CNS could be sensitive to Amplitude-Modulated with kHz carrier frequency but not unmodulated sinusoidal waveform is not yet understood. Explaining the cellular mechanism of Amplitude-Modulated high-frequency stimulation is thus of interest in developing rational optimized stimulation strategies. The effect of Amplitude-Modulated high-frequency electric fields on ongoing network activity was evaluated in carbachol-induced gamma oscillation in CA3a region of rat hippocampal slices. Extracellular local field potentials were analyzed before, during and after 2 s of stimulation. We tested unmodulated sine waveforms with low frequency (i.e. 5 Hz), kHz frequency (i.e. 1 and 2 kHz) and 5 Hz Amplitude-Modulated waveforms with 0.1, 1, and 2 kHz carrier frequencies. A validated MRI-derived head model predicted both peak electric fields in the cortex and depth of Amplitude-Modulation at deep regions during TI. We further developed a computational model of excitatory/inhibitory neuronal network with conductance-based synaptic interactions to explain the experimental results. Both experiment and model confirmed the hypothesis that spatial selectivity of temporal interference stimulation depends on the phasic modulation of neural oscillations only in deep brain regions. Adaptation mechanism (e.g. GABAb) enhanced sensitivity to amplitude modulated waveform in contrast to unmodulated kHz and produced selectivity in modulating gamma oscillation. Selection of carrier frequency strongly affected sensitivity to amplitude modulation stimulation. The TI sensitivity (current required at the scalp) depends on the active neuronal membrane time-constant approaching the kHz carrier frequency.",Zeinab Esmaeilpour,"Greg Kronberg, City college of New York; Davide Reato,Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Neuroscience Program, Lisbon, Portuga; lucas C parra, city college of New York; Marom Bikson, city college of New York",City College of New York (grid.254250.4),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-29 18:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 18:30:00+00:00,
recAa14jr9kgZQXgh,Influence of the BDNF Val66Met Polymorphism on Modulation of Functional Brain Networks,"Human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important protein responsible for the development and maintenance of neurons. Polymorphisms (i.e., genetic variations) of the BDNF protein have been implicated in overall reduction of functional connectivity (FC) within and between large-scale functional brain networks. Specifically, the well studied Val66Met BDNF polymorphism has been shown to impact connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), a group of brain regions critically involved in internally focused cognition. Furthermore, this polymorphism of BDNF protein has been shown to influence the effectiveness of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This presents a potential problem in using NIBS to modulate FC of brain networks in experimental and clinical settings (e.g., treatment of depression). We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with intermittent and continuous theta burst rTMS in young adults to evaluate the influence of the Val66Met polymorphism of BDNF on baseline FC of large-scale intrinsic functional networks, and the ability to modulate within and between-network FC using NIBS. The rTMS target stimulation site selected was the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), a core node of the DMN, and was identified individually for a Val homozygote and a Met homozygote through functional task fMRI data. Resting-state fMRI data were collected before and after administering rTMS to the IPL. Results showed a reduction in baseline FC for a Met homozygote compared to a Val homozygote, both within the DMN and between the DMN and other large-scale brain networks. Furthermore, we found the ability to modulate within and between-network FC through rTMS was improved for a Val homozygote compared to a Met homozygote.

recAeRdue1yGx5p0J,Social Transmission of Maternal Behaviors through Observation,"Oxytocin is a peptide hormone important for maternal physiology and social behaviors (Jurek & Neumann Physiol Rev 2018). One behavior influenced by central oxytocin signaling in rodents is pup retrieval (Marlin et al. Nature 2015; Scott et al. Nature 2015). When mouse pups are out of the nest, they emit vocalizations that prompt dams to fetch the pup back to the nest. Virgin females do not initially retrieve pups, but can learn to retrieve after several days of co-housing with an experienced mother and pups in a manner that may involve visual observational learning of dams interacting with the nest and pups (Carcea et al. BioRxiv 2019). 
To explore what aspects of maternal behavior are socially transmitted, we showed audio-visual movies to head-fixed awake virgins that initially did not retrieve. It allows us to manipulate the sensory stimuli presented to the virgins and further explore experience-related effects on behavior and neural activity. Our data (n=11) shows that virgins can learn to retrieve in the virtual setup, while virgins presented with dark background did not learn to retrieve (n=14). Alternatively, virgins presented with videos of maternal mistakes (out of the nest retrievals; n=4) or non-maternal behaviors (video of conspecific; n=8) lead to decreased performance. This setup is an essential step towards understanding which visual stimuli are informative for retrieval learning. It will allow us to manipulate sensorial experience, and employ electrophysiological and optogenetical techniques to further explore the role of oxytocin on social behavior.

Despite their diverse life histories, vertebrates share the same overall brain architecture, which is established during early embryonic development. Are correspondences, or homologies, extending beyond coarse brain regions, to the level of cell types and circuits? To address this question, we are studying cell types in the telencephalon, a brain region where the dramatic expansion of neuronal diversity in evolution is associated to morphological and functional novelties. We used single-cell transcriptomics to identify cell types in the simple three-layered cortex of reptiles, the sister group of mammals, and we are starting new work on an amphibian, the Spanish ribbed newt Pleurodeles waltl. Our quantitative comparison of single-cell transcriptomes across species sheds new light on the evolution of the mammalian six-layered neocortex. The transcriptomic signature of glutamatergic neurons in non-mammals suggests that mammalian neocortical layers are made of new cell types generated by diversification of ancestral gene-regulatory programs. By contrast, we find that the transcriptomes of cortical GABAergic neurons are conserved to an exquisite detail, suggesting that developmental or functional constraints shape the evolution of these cell types.

Recently, progress has been made to relate this behaviour to neural data. A number of computational models have been proposed to explain various aspects of the perceptual decision. Typically, those studies consider only a single dimensional binary decision. The multi-attribute decision-making research often focuses on multi-modal stimuli, ie. with different accumulation rates between attributes. Moreover, the evidence from animal studies shows that the brain tends to sum reward predictions from multiple cues. The details of the combination of evidence have not been studied in details in the perceptual decision paradigm, especially among the human subjects. In this study, we test whether the human brain combines the input from two information sources linearly (additively). We modify the classical random dots motion discrimination task by adding an additional axis of dots movement. We show that there are significant differences in terms of accuracy and reaction time between decisions made from the same amount of information provided by a single and two axes. In the congruent condition the accuracy and reaction times were lower when participants had to combine the data, but for the incongruent condition, participants were faster (but less accurate) when exposed to two axes.

recApLfrPTJRTGc2B,Transcriptomic contributions to the cytoarchitectonic parcellation of the human cerebral cortex.,"Abstract: 
Transcriptomic contributions to the functional and anatomical parcellation of the human cerebral cortex has become a major interest in systems neuroscience in the last decade. Recent research shows that active transcription of a small set of genes contributes to large-scale gradients and functional hierarchies in the human cerebral cortex (1,2). The combination of our previous findings has shown that different sets of genes contribute to the positioning of cortical areas within functional hierarchies (2) and the organization of functional maps within each cortical area (3). Here, we tested if either set of genes previously identified better explained the recent identification of over 88 cytoarchitectonic areas (4). Using a data-driven approach, we show that the genes previously identified to explain the functional organization of the visual processing hierarchy in human cortex better explains the arealization of these 88 cytoarchitectonic areas than the genes explaining functional maps within each visual area. Importantly, follow-up analyses show that an additional set of genes contribute to the cytoarchitectonic parcellation of the human cerebral cortex beyond those genes contributing to the parcellation of the human visual processing hierarchy. These results support a novel hypothesis that there is a nested spatial relationship among transcriptomic, anatomical, and functional parcellations of the human cerebral cortex at the level of maps (mm; areal), gradients and hierarchies (cm; within lobes), and networks (several cm; across lobes). We conclude by showing that a microanatomical substrate supporting this hypothesis across spatial scales is cell density.

recAss5l8wdgBbnAm,When are open- and closed-loop control necessary for causal inference in neural circuits?,"Many hypotheses about neural circuits are best stated in terms of causal relationships: “Activity in this region causes an observed change in that downstream region.” Furthermore, the development of effective therapeutic interventions requires knowledge of the causal relationship between potential therapies, markers of disease states, and patient outcomes. However, in experiments where interventions such as lesioning are unavailable, a key ambiguity remains as to whether activity is correlated across two populations because of a structural feedforward connection, or instead arises through recurrent connections or unseen, confounding common inputs. Closed-loop approaches appear to be a promising solution because they can hold regions constant, decoupling them from confounding feedback pathways while maintaining naturalistic activity levels.
However, despite the increasing interest in closed-loop control from the systems neuroscience community, it is still poorly understood in which settings these approaches are necessary, and how best to design interventions. What is needed is a characterization of how and when closed-loop control improves identification in representative simulations of neural circuits. 
In this work we (1) summarize and integrate the existing understanding of network identification across several fields: systems neuroscience, control theory, and causal inference; (2) present a simplified approach for predicting whether two circuit hypotheses may be distinguished from data collected with passive, open-loop or closed-loop experiments; and (3) use a small network simulation of integrate and fire neurons to illustrate how network properties, including synaptic strength and internal time constants, impact how well the underlying causal structure of a circuit can be reconstructed.
	While this work examines a simple set of circuits, we hope that it facilitates a broader discussion around how to design interventions, and how to understand the limits of causal identification across a broad range of neural systems.",Adam Willats (he/him),"Adam Willats, Georgia Institute of Technology & Emory University; Matthew O'Shaughnessy, Georgia Institute of Technology; Kyle Johnsen, Georgia Institute of Technology & Emory University; Christopher Rozell, Georgia Institute of Technology",Georgia Institute of Technology (grid.213917.f),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-27 21:15:00+00:00,2020-10-27 21:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/oUKBDF2B3Sw

DpMe cells have been shown to respond to passive vestibular (rotational) stimuli, which suggests that this region plays an important role in vestibulo-motor control. However, DpMe responses to active movements, such as locomotion have not yet been characterized. Here we recorded continuous single unit extracellular activities from the DpMe in rhesus monkeys. First, we applied passive translations and rotation to characterize the vestibular responses of neurons in the DpMe. Head-mounted 3Dgyroscopes/3Daccelerometers were used to record the head motion, and neural sensitivities to passive vestibular modulation were computed. Second, we recorded from the same DPME neurons during head-fixed treadmill walking.  Four high-speed cameras were used for motion recording synchronously. Deep-learning computer-vision toolbox (DeepLabCut) were used to extract the animals' 3D posture for gait analysis. We found that, when compared to resting activities, DpMe cells demonstrated a significant overall increase in activity during head-fixed treadmill walking. Notably, DpMe cells demonstrated phase-dependent modulation during walking, even in the absence of vestibular stimulation. Modulation patterns varied between DpMe cells- some cells demonstrated peak activity during swing phase, and others during stance. Taken together these results suggest that DpMe neurons play a critical role in processing multi-sensory input during the complex sensorimotor activities generated in everyday life, such as walking. In addition, our findings also advance our knowledge of the neural circuits that coordinate gait and balance and thus have important implications for the development of novel treatments and interventions.",Rui-Han Wei,"Erez Gugig, Johns Hopkins University;Oliver Stanley, Johns Hopkins University; Kathleen Cullen, Johns Hopkins University",Johns Hopkins University (grid.21107.35),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-26 18:00:00+00:00,2020-10-26 18:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/ESTWqG9JxYk
recAuPD4cd7bGpjVH,Modeling center-surround antagonism in neurons for potential application in the optogenetic gene therapy of retinal degeneration,"Retinal degenerative diseases lead to the death of photoreceptor cells and, ultimately, to blindness. Using optogenetics, it is possible to express light-activated membrane proteins (opsins) in survived retinal neurons to create artificial photoreceptors. A promising approach is to model center-surround antagonism in retinal neurons to partly restore visual information processing. In our study we used pyramidal neurons of mice and rats as a model system to model center-surround antagonism for possible use in the treatment of retinal degeneration.
  
We created a genetic construct carrying the genes of excitatory (CHR2) and inhibitory (GtACR2) light-activated proteins. A mutant IRES sequence was inserted between two genes to ensure an accurate two-gene expression ratio in each cell and to reduce the expression of the inhibitory opsin gene. In addition, excitatory opsin was targeted to the somatic region of cells using the Kv2.1 motif. We conducted transfection of mouse cortical neurons and primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons with this genetic construct. Electrical activity of transfected neurons in primary cultures and brain slices was recorded by whole-cell patch-clamp. Blue light stimulation was applied to the central or peripheral area of a neuron. 

It was shown that light stimulation of the central area of the transfected neuron leads to cell activation. In contrast, light stimulation of the peripheral area of the neuron causes suppression of neuronal activity.

In our study, the center-surround antagonism was successfully modeled in neurons. The genetic construct containing genes of two light-activated proteins could have potential application in the therapy of retinal degeneration by delivery to retinal neurons using viral vectors.

However, current state-of-the-art probes such as microwire and silicon electrodes are much stiffer than brain tissue, which largely increases the chance of inflammation, and therefore makes it difficult to consistently record high-quality signals over long period of time. Parylene C is a promising alternative structural and insulation material for building neural probes with reduced mechanical mismatch between tissue and implants. In our previous work, a 64-channel Parylene-based multi-electrode array with 8 shanks was developed and applied to chronic recording of the hippocampus in behaving rats. In our current work, a novel 3D Parylene-based probe consisting of 16 (2x8) shanks with a 250um spacing was developed. Each shank contains 8 platinum electrodes and thereby has a total of 128 electrodes. To aid insertion, dissolvable polyethylene glycol (PEG) brace was employed to temporarily support the flexible probe. The 3D Parylene probe was implanted at 2.6mm posterior to the bregma and 2.4mm lateral to the midline at a depth of 4.4mm. 59 units of neuronal activities were recorded immediately after the implantation. 6 shanks recorded 8 units from CA1 while 9 shanks recorded 51 units from CA3. Histology showed that the shanks were straightly inserted within the 2.5mm depth and began to split after this depth, which was due to the different dissolving rates on the surface of the PEG block. This preliminary result demonstrated the feasibility of implanting 3D flexible polymer probe to deep brain structures for large-scale recordings. In the next step, different insertion methods will be investigated to ensure straight insertion of the probes. The large-scale 3D Parylene probe will be tested both acutely and chronically for recording from multiple hippocampal regions in behaving rats.",Wenxuan Jiang,"Xuechun Wang, University of Southern California; Huijing Xu, University of Southern California; Ellis Meng, University of Southern California; Dong Song, University of Southern California",University of Southern California (grid.42505.36),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-27 22:00:00+00:00,2020-10-27 22:15:00+00:00,
recB5NSuQ0dZEKkA5,Transmitter switching contributes to two environmental models of  neurodevelopmental disorders,"Early environmental factors play a key role in emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders and cortical neurotransmitter imbalance is a convergent phenotype seen across different types of disorders. Neurotransmitter switching involves loss of one transmitter and gain of another often changing the sign of the synapse from excitatory to inhibitory or vice versa and altering behavior (Spitzer, 2017). We are testing the hypothesis that transmitter switching contributes to these disorders in mouse models. We treat pregnant females with either Poly Inosine:Cytosine (Poly I:C) or valproic acid (VPA)  at embryonic day E12.5 and assess the progeny for molecular and behavioral changes.
    Both treatments cause a transient decrease of 6000 GAD67+ neurons and an equal increase of vGluT1+ neurons in the mPFC at postnatal day (P)10 in experimental mice compared to controls that disappears by P90. These changes do not result from altered number of precursors or apoptosis and occur specifically in PV+ and CCK+ neurons. P90 animals demonstrate enhanced stereotypy and deficits in social interaction compared to controls.  
    Stereotaxic injection of P9 PV-Cre/CCK-Cre Poly I:C-treated mice with Cre-dependent HSV-GFP revealed vGluT1+GFP+ neurons in the neonatal mPFC at P13 demonstrating expression of vGluT1 in a subset of PV-Cre/CCK-Cre neurons, providing evidence for transmitter switching in single neurons.
    To test the role of the transmitter switch in emergence of behavioral deficits, we stereotaxically injected P9 male and female PV-Cre/CCK-Cre mice with Cre-dependent HSV-GAD1-GFP. This restored GAD67+GFP+ neurons in PV and CCK cells in experimental mice and prevented gain of vGluT1 in GFP+ neurons by P13 unlike Poly I:C-treated controls injected with HSV-GFP. Restoring GAD67 also rescued altered behavior in P90 experimental male mice.

However, typically studies have only examined performance in the virtual testbeds, without asking how performance in the virtual environment compares to behavior in the real world. To test whether performance in the virtual environment is a valid representation of corresponding behavioral features in the real world, this study compared throwing in a virtual set-up with realistic throwing where the task parameters were precisely matched. Even though the virtual task only required a horizontal single-joint arm movement, similar to many simplified movement assays in motor neuroscience and also modeling, throwing accuracy and precision was significantly better in the real task; only after three practice days did success rate and error reach same levels. To gain more insight into the structure of the learning process movement variability was decomposed into deterministic and stochastic contributions. Using the Tolerance-Noise-Covariation decomposition method revealed distinct stages of learning: Tolerance was optimized first in both environments but was higher in the virtual environment, suggesting that more familiarization and exploration is needed in the virtual task. Covariation and noise showed far fewer and only contributions late in practice of the real task, indicating that subjects reached the stage of fine-tuning of deterministic and stochastic aspects of variability only in the real task. These results showed that while the tasks were precisely matched, the simplified movements in the virtual environment required more time to be successful.

recBI7l6aLExHlAg8,Autonomic Dysfunction in Parkinson’s Disease: An Application of Machine Learning for Clinical Diagnosis,"Background: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by cardinal motor symptoms including tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movement. Today, diagnosis relies on the presence of motor symptoms when predominant lesions have already occurred peripherally and centrally. However, nonmotor symptoms such as autonomic dysfunction appear prior to motor symptoms and have the potential to serve as biomarkers for prodromal PD. The goal of the current study is to assess autonomic dysfunction as a possible biomarker in patients with Parkinson’s Disease. 

Methods: We measured subjective autonomic symptoms as well as heart rate variability and blood pressure in patients with PD and healthy subjects. The clinical data was analyzed to discriminate between the parkinsonian and healthy state using a suite of machine learning algorithms. The relative importance of different biomarkers was extracted to determine which features of autonomic dysfunction are most predictive of PD. 

Results:  Machine learning algorithms attained high accuracy (F1 > 0.80) in classifying between PD and control subjects. Nonlinear features of heart rate variability were the most important features, including Approximate Entropy and the Hurst Exponent. Statistical analysis confirmed significantly lower levels of entropy in patients with PD. PCA achieved lower accuracy (76%) in comparison to the machine learning ensemble. PCA showed that Hurst Exponent and High Frequency spectral power were positively correlated with the parkinsonian state, while Median Instantaneous Frequency and Entropy were negatively correlated with the parkinsonian state. 

Conclusions: Machine learning analysis revealed that autonomic dysfunction was highly predictive of PD. The high-ranking performance of nonlinear features suggests that autonomic control is more complex than antagonistic interactions between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Additionally, the effective performance of nonlinear features suggests their utility as biomarkers for early stage PD.

In general, the registered images could be checked manually or semi-manually for quality of alignment. However, this visual quality control becomes a tedious process when we deal with big data MRI processing containing thousands of images. Therefore, there is a strong need to fully automate this quality checking process. Hence, I propose to develop and deploy different machine learning (ML) classifiers for quality checking of both rigid and affine registrations. 
Firstly, the cost functions such as normalized cross-correlation, normalized mutual information and correlation ratio are computed by comparing the subject’s registration to the template with the template. These cost values are computed locally at a 3x3x3 volume of interest (VOI) and further moving this VOI with a stride of 3. Final cost value is the average of cost values obtained in each VOI. Further, these are also the features used for training different ML classifiers including linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, kNN, random forest, Gaussian naive bayes. These ML classifiers are 5-fold cross validated on a subset of T1-weighted MRI data from autism brain imaging data exchange (ABIDE I) consisting of 220 images. These images were rigidly and affinely transformed to the template by using the FSL interface in Nipype. Further, 220 incorrectly registered images were generated by changing the values in transformation matrices and then applying these modified matrices to register the image to the template. 
All ML classifiers achieved a testing accuracy of 99.9 % for both rigid and affine registrations.

The research on schizophrenia using machine learning techniques and neuroimaging is an active area of study. The functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) helps to identify the brain activity in voxels, consisting of measured changes in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals over time. Based on the fMRI data of 34 schizophrenia patients and 34 healthy controls, we performed a Region of Interest (ROI) study on the identified brain regions for studying hundreds of literature over the last 30 years. Besides, we parcellate the brain into four levels of hierarchy, Hemisphere, Gyrus, Lobes, and Cell type (Broadmann Areas). We applied statistical feature selection techniques, such as t-test and Pearson's Correlation on the preprocessed data to identify the significant regions in each level. The selected features were used for training several machine learning classifiers to analyze the prediction performance of affected brain regions. As for the machine learning approach, we used various classifiers such as K-nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Extreme Learning Machines. We achieved the highest classification accuracy of around 84 % on the Pearson's correlation selected Lobe's data, 84 % on the Broadmann areas' data, and similarly 81 % on the Gyrus data and Hemisphere data. Furthermore, we performed backtracking of the statistically significant selected features and visualized them better to understand the affected brain areas in schizophrenia patients. The reviewed papers depicted region-wise changes in schizophrenia confirm our findings. With the result of our work, we examined the previous research conclusions on an ROI-based approach. Also, we found some affected brain regions, which were never reported before in the literature on schizophrenia. These new findings may open up a possible way of understanding schizophrenia patients' brains from different perspectives.

recBR1KJwK7287wIC,Expectations can boost the encoding of specific features of noisy speech,"Expectations about our environment can help us extract meaningful signals from noisy sensory inputs. In some cases, our brain can even replace what is missing, a phenomenon called perceptual filling-in. However, it is still unclear whether perceptual filling-in changes the encoding of information or acts on post-encoding processes.

Here, we investigated auditory perceptual filling-in in 19 participants who listened to two categories of noisy speech: (1) noise vocoded speech (NVS), in which spectral features are replaced by amplitude-modulated band-limited noise, and (2) sine-wave speech (SWS), in which formants are replaced with sinusoids. Both SWS and NVS were created from intelligible speech. Participants were instructed to rate the clarity of NVS and SWS stimuli before and after seeing the original sentence (prior+), a different sentence (prior-), or nothing at all (prior0). High-density EEG was recorded throughout the task.

Displaying the correct (prior+) or incorrect (prior-) sentence induced a state of active listening, characterised by an increase in alpha oscillations. However, only the display of the original sentence (prior+) had a positive effect on clarity (perceptual insight). To investigate how expectations shaped sensory encoding, we used a technique designed to reconstruct auditory features (envelope, spectrogram, phonemes, etc) from the EEG recorded during sound presentation. Stimulus reconstruction was more efficient following the presentation of the correct (prior+) compared to the incorrect sentence (prior-). This increase in stimulus reconstruction was accompanied by a desynchronization within the theta band.

recBS6QhUnEMIjEkf,Hippocampal representations emerge when training recurrent neural networks on a memory dependent maze navigation task,"Can neural networks learn goal-directed behaviour using similar strategies the brain uses to combine the relationships between the current state of the organism and the consequences of future actions? Recent work has shown that recurrent neural networks trained on goal based tasks can develop representations resembling those found in the brain, entorhinal cortex grid cells, for instance. Here we explore the evolution of the dynamics of their internal representations and compare this with experimental data. We observe that once a recurrent network is trained to learn the structure of its environment solely based on sensory prediction, an attractor based landscape forms in the network's representation, which parallels hippocampal place cells in structure and function. Next, we extend the predictive objective to include Q-learning for a reward task, where rewarding actions are dependent on delayed cue modulation. Mirroring experimental findings in hippocampus recordings in rodents performing the same task, this training paradigm causes nonlocal neural activity to sweep forward in space at decision points, anticipating the future path to a rewarded location. Moreover, prevalent choice and cue-selective neurons form in this network, again recapitulating experimental findings. Together, these results indicate that combining predictive, unsupervised learning of the structure of an environment with reinforcement learning can help understand the formation of hippocampus-like representations containing both spatial and task-relevant information.",Justin Jude,"Matthias Hennig, University of Edinburgh",University of Edinburgh (grid.4305.2),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-29 12:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 12:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/DZB9GLmHQp0
recBV0NGtr0aPOK1g,Grouped single-unit activity in a cortical avian nucleus supports a population model of birdsong production in Serinus canaria,"Birdsong requires fine coordination of the muscles in the vocal organ and respiratory system. The song system, which is the neural architecture dedicated to song production in oscine birds, poses a beautiful opportunity to model the activity of a circuit of interconnected neural nuclei for the production of complex behaviour.

Such a model has been developed previously by our laboratory. Our model makes specific predictions about the timing of population neural activity in different nuclei needed to produce song and can reproduce respiratory patterns observed in canary song phrases of different types.

In this work, the model was used to generate respiratory patterns that correspond to two types of phrases of canary song, given a proposed sparse activity in nucleus HVC (proper name), one of the nuclei involved. This telencephalic nucleus plays a key role in the production of motor commands, but the neural code it uses is still under debate.

We put our model to the test by recording extracellularly from nucleus HVC in singing canaries, isolating single-units that fire during particular phrase types and analyzing at which song instances these neurons fire.

We found that grouped activity across animals is in good correspondence to the population activity that can produce realistic respiratory patterns in our model for the two types of phrases studied. Furthermore, the experimental data show activity in additional song instances that will enrich further iterations of the model.",Cecilia Herbert (she/her),"Santiago Boari, Dpto. de Física, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina and Instituto de Física de Buenos Aires, IFIBA-CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Gabriel B.

recBWTkdP3XK85krl,An Application of Wavelet Transforms to Identify the Spatial Scale of Multivariate Activity Patterns in Functional MRI data,"The brain is hierarchically organized across different spatial scales. In occipital cortex, the question of whether visual information is represented at a fine or coarse spatial scale remains debated. Common methods for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, such as multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques, often neglect the spatial structure of brain activity patterns. Past approaches to investigating spatial scales, such as smoothing, do not allow individual spatial scales to be stringently confined. In this study, we applied a method for quantifying spatial scales –the wavelet transform– that overcomes these limitations. With this technique, we define a set of features that take scale and directionality information into account to represent activity patterns using a dual-tree complex wavelet transform (dt-CWT). We classified these features from fMRI data collected as participants viewed four visual categories (faces, places, artifacts, fruits) using the XGBoost algorithm, for each of five spatial scales generated by the wavelets. In occipital cortex, we were able to decode visual categories based on the features generated using the wavelets at coarser but not finer spatial scales. These results suggest visual categories differ more in their spatial organization at lower frequencies in occipital cortex. The categories could not be decoded based on their spatial scales in ventral temporal cortex, suggesting they may be represented at similar spatial scales.",Xueying Ren(Ms),"Heather Bruett, University of Pittsburgh; Marc N.

Nevertheless, the intrinsic coordinate representation and underlying processes for this combination remain a puzzle, mainly due to inadequacy of current theoretical models to explain data at different levels (i.e. behaviour, single neuron, or distributed networks). In response, we aim to build a theoretical framework to tackle this challenge. In particular, we propose a physiologically inspired neural network with two major components. First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the allocentric and target information: Our CNN performs repeated convolution, rectifications, and normalization to first extract low level features from input images. With the features extracted, the challenge is to combine them to generate an abstract representation (allocentric cues and target position). We address this challenge by training a feature pooling layer at the end of our CNN network. Second, a Multi-Layer Perceptron network (MLP), which combines the allocentric information, here extracted feature maps from the CNN, with egocentric information, here initial gaze position, and generates the final gaze position: Our MLP consists of three fully connected hidden layers. These three layers incrementally transform the separately input allocentric and egocentric representations into an integrated motor response. Finally, following the MLP, an additional layer transforms motor responses into final gaze positions. We were able to train these physiologically-inspired networks to achieve good correspondence with test dataset (MLP: R2 = 0.99). These results suggest that our framework provides a suitable tool to study the underlying mechanisms of allocentric and egocentric integration.

We utilized diffusion MRI and reproducible, cloud-computing methods to characterize the development of these vertical white matter tracts in a cross-sectional sample of 24 children (5-8 years old) and 12 adults (18-22 years old). We then compared the development of these posterior vertical tracts to the development of horizontal tracts within the ventral and dorsal visual streams. Horizontal tracts within the ventral stream had FA that was more adult-like than horizontal tracts in the dorsal cortex, consistent with prior work. The development of the posterior vertical tracts was more similar to the development of the horizontal tracts in the ventral visual stream than tracts in the dorsal cortex, with higher FA values found in adults than in children. In one tract, the pArc, FA was predicted by performance on a perceptual matching task in the child sample. Our results suggest that posterior vertical tracts develop later than ventral stream tracts, but earlier than tracts in the dorsal cortex, and that the development of posterior vertical tracts may be related to the influence of perceptual processing on dorsally-mediated action in childhood.",Sophia Vinci-Booher,"Vinci-Booher, S., Indiana University; Bullock, D., Indiana University;  Caron, B., Indiana University; James, K.H., Indiana University; Pestilli, F. , Indiana University, University of Texas",Indiana University (grid.257410.5),"Theme A: Development, Neurodegenerative Disorders and Injury",Traditional talk,2020-10-28 13:00:00+00:00,2020-10-28 13:15:00+00:00,

recBtjLpNNDqKJBxU,Cortico-cerebellar networks as decoupled neural interfaces,"The brain solves the credit assignment problem remarkably well. For credit to be correctly assigned across multiple cortical areas a given area should, in principle, wait for others to finish their computation. How the brain deals with this locking problem has remained unclear. Deep learning methods suffer from similar locking constraints both on the forward and backward phase. Recently, decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) were introduced as a solution to the forward and backward locking problems.
Here we propose that a specialised brain region, the cerebellum, helps the cerebral cortex solve the locking problem closely matching the computations and architecture of DNI. In particular, we propose that classical cerebellar forward and inverse models are equivalent to solving the backward and forward locking problems, respectively. We tested the cortico-cerebellar-DNI (CC-DNI) model in a range of sensorimotor and cognitive tasks that have been shown to be cerebellar-dependent. First, we show that the CC-DNI unlocking mechanisms can facilitate learning in a simple target reaching task. Next, by building on the sequential MNIST task we demonstrate that these results generalise to more complex sensorimotor tasks. Our cortico-cerebellar model readily applies to a wider range of modalities, to demonstrate this we tested the model in a cognitive task, caption generation. Models without the cerebellar-DNI component exhibit deficits similar to what has been observed in cerebellar patients in both motor and cognitive tasks. Finally, we introduce a CC-DNI model with highly sparse connectivity as observed in the cerebellum, which substantially reduces the number of parameters while improving learning through decorrelation.
Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the cerebellum as a brain-wide decoupling machine for efficient credit assignment and opens a new avenue of research between deep learning and neuroscience.",Joseph Pemberton,Ellen Boven; Rui Ponte Costa; Richard Apps,University of Bristol (grid.5337.2),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-29 10:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 10:15:00+00:00,
recBxjJMU1ciAdEdk,Neural flexibility and the propensity to change opinions following online media consumption,"Digital persuasive media have a profound effect on decision-making. Recent communication neuroscience research shows a significant relationship between frontal brain regional activity and opinion change. Despite these findings, the neural dynamics that give rise to this relationship and the extent to which these effects extend beyond the laboratory are largely unexplored. Here, we utilize a network science approach -- dynamic community detection -- to extract brain network dynamics, and extend this method to data that mirrors neural activity of digital media consumers today. We investigate the dynamic coactivity of neural correlates of opinion change, as prompted by consumption of online persuasive media. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was collected from 240 healthy and diverse participants while interacting with biased content in a social media environment. Before and after interacting with the platform, participants were asked their opinions on vaccinations, capital punishment, corporate investment practices and politics. After calculating opinion change scores, we estimated the statistical relationship of the bandpassed EEG data (delta: 1-3Hz, theta: 4-7Hz, alpha: 8-12 Hz, beta: 13-25Hz, gamma: 30-40Hz) between electrodes with a weighted phase-lag index (wPLI). These connectivity matrices were then subjected to the dynamic community detection algorithm to extract network metrics that quantify the propensity of “nodes” (electrodes, here) to change their network affiliation across time.  We show that network flexibility and promiscuity of frontal nodes, specifically within gamma and alpha bands, during engagement with persuasive digital content, are significantly associated with opinion change. These results indicate that coactivation of the frontal brain region with other network communities explains, in part, an individual’s likelihood to alter their position on a sensitive issue.

Candidate mechanisms are metabolic syndrome, consisting of inflammation, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. While there have been several neuroimaging studies linking adiposity to changes in brain morphometry, a comprehensive investigation of the relationship has so far not been done. Here we use structural equation modelling in 15,000 individuals from the UK Biobank to identify the causal chain linking adiposity to cognitive dysfunction. We found that body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio were positively related to higher plasma C-reactive protein, dyslipidemia, occurrence of hypertension and diabetes, all of which were in turn related to cerebrovascular disease as measured by volume of white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging. White mater hyperintensities were associated with lower cortical thickness and volume and higher subcortical volumes, which were associated with cognitive deficits.

recC7taFZp18NCcx4,Audio-visual training in older adults: 2-Interval-Forced Choice Task improves performance,"A growing interest in ameliorating multisensory perception deficits in older adults arises from recent evidence showing that impaired multisensory processing, particularly in the temporal domain, may be associated with cognitive and functional impairments. Older adults exhibit an extended temporal binding window (the timeframe during which the brain integrates inputs from different senses into a multisensory percept) which has been associated with mild cognitive impairment and falls-risk. Perceptual training has proved successful in improving multisensory temporal processing in young adults, but few studies have investigated this training approach in older adults. In the present study we used a simultaneity (or synchronicity) judgement task with feedback, to train the audio-visual abilities of community-dwelling, cognitively healthy older adults. We recruited 23 older adults (M = 74.17, SD = 6.23)  and a group of 20 young adults (M = 24.20, SD = 4.23) who served as a comparison. Participants were tested before and after perceptual training using a 2-Interval Forced Choice Task (2-IFC); and the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI). After three days of training, participants improved on the 2-IFC task, with a significant narrowing of the temporal window of integration found for both groups. Generalisation of training effects was not found, with no post-training differences in perceptual sensitivity to the SIFI for either group. These findings provide evidence perceptual narrowing can be achieved in older as well as younger adults after three days of perceptual training. This research contributes to mounting evidence that multisensory processing deficits in older adults’ can be modified through targeted perceptual training. Perceptual training could potentially represent a novel intervention avenue for populations whose impairments are associated with underlying multisensory processing difficulties (e.g. fall-prone older adults).",Jessica  O'Brien,"Annalisa Setti, University College Cork; Jason Chan, University College Cork",University College Cork (grid.7872.a),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-27 16:15:00+00:00,2020-10-27 16:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/NOKvz_0MK74

However, the underlying plasticity rules that govern learning are unknown.
Many proposals have been suggested, including Hebbian mechanisms, explicit error backpropagation, and a variety of alternatives.
It is an open question as to what specific experimental measurements would need to be made to determine whether any given learning rule is operative in a real biological systems.
In this work, we take a ""virtual experimental"" approach to this problem.
Simulating idealized neuroscience experiments with artificial neural networks, we generate a large-scale dataset of learning trajectories of aggregate statistics measured in a variety of neural network architectures, loss functions, learning rule hyperparameters, and parameter initializations.
We then take a discriminative approach, training linear and simple non-linear classifiers to identify learning rules from features based on these observables.
We show that different classes of learning rules can be separated solely on the basis of aggregate statistics of the weights, activations, or instantaneous layer-wise activity changes, and that these results generalize to limited access to the trajectory and held-out architectures and learning curricula.
We identify the statistics of each observable that are most relevant for rule identification, finding that statistics from network activities across training are more robust to unit undersampling and measurement noise than those obtained from the synaptic strengths.

We trained monkeys to remember the location of a stimulus and determine whether a second stimulus appeared at the same location or not. Neurophysiological recordings were performed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex. We hypothesized that random drifts causing the peak activity of the network to move away from the first stimulus location and towards the location of the second stimulus would result in categorical errors. Indeed, for both areas, in non-matching trials, when the first stimulus appeared in a neuron’s preferred location, the neuron showed significantly higher firing rates in correct than in error trials, and vice versa, when the first stimulus appeared at a non-preferred location, activity in error trials was higher than in correct.

Background: Repetitive movement disorders, such as tics and stereotypies, are common in the pediatric population. Although alterations in cortical-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits may be involved, there are numerous unanswered questions. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) provide a non-pharmacologically induced model for studying underlying mechanisms. 

Methodology: Investigative approaches, to date, have included stereological studies designed to identify anatomical alterations in the cortex, striatum, and cerebellum, and techniques that quantify regional neurotransmitters (e.g., LC-MS and RNAscope).  
Results: Stereological studies have identified a significant negative correlation between cell count in the ventral striatum and repetitive activity. Neurochemically, a significant negative correlation was observed between the repetitive activity of deer mice and the LC-MS/MS quantified endogenous opioids (leu-enkephalin (enk) and dynorphin-A (dyn-A) in the frontal cortex (FC) [Augustine et al. 2020]. Based on these findings, we have postulated that endogenous opioids in the cortex regulate the balance of activity within cortical-striatal pathways, either via goal-directed/habitual pathways, direct/indirect systems, or inhibitory circuits. For example, the FC originates habitual behaviors via cortical projections to striatal medium-spiny-neurons (MSNs) that participate in the DRD1-expressing (direct) and DRD2-expressing (indirect) motor pathways. 

Current Studies: Studies in progress, using in-situ mRNA hybridization, are designed to examine the dopaminergic and endogenous opioid systems in the striatum and FC. To date, we have quantified the mRNA expression levels of DRD1/DRD2 and the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors (MOR, DOR, and KOR, respectively) in the FC and striatal regions. Preliminary data shows a negative correlation between the repetitive behavior activity and mRNA expression of dyn-A and enk in the FC, further supporting our initial report proposing a role for endogenous opioids as an underlying mechanism for repetitive behaviors.",Farhan Augustine,"Shawn Doss, Johns Hopkins University; Harvey S.

In contrast, robotic approaches must work in the real world with delays, nonlinearities and noise - posing a greater challenge on the proposed architectures, and promising greater insight. Commercially available robots with pre-programmed control systems are an appropriate solution to perform certain tasks from the get-go. From a theoretical perspective, however, this can be limiting since alternative control architectures cannot be tested. Here we built a simple robot arm with two shoulder joints, elbow and wrist, from the ground up, 3D printed arm segments, DC motors as actuators; potentiometers, pressure and tilt sensors and a webcam for sensory input. We programmed the control architecture for visual and kinesthetic arm control on a PC and an Arduino-compatible microcontroller. The robot performed a planar reaching task and a tracking task following a continuously moving visual reference, while simultaneously maintaining constant pen pressure and angle of tilt. While modest in speed and precision, the robot arm successfully performed these tasks, showing biologically relevant movement features, such as bell-shaped speed profiles, isochronous rise times, and the emergence of the speed-curvature power law at high speeds. Next, we imposed movement constraints and perturbations such as inclining the writing surface, displacing the visual marker, blocking the wrist, and rotating the visual field. Without any learning algorithms or parameter adjustments, the robot performed successful reaching and tracking.

recCSnXVdeeVrIPax,The development of the brain circuitry of conscious awareness in infancy,"One of the great frontiers of consciousness science is understanding how early consciousness arises in the development of the human infant. The reciprocal relationship between the default mode network (DMN) and dorsal attention network (DAN)/executive control network (ECN) has been suggested as a key feature of the brain mechanisms of conscious awareness. Nevertheless, it is poorly understood whether this relationship is present in new-born infants, or indeed whether DMN, DAN and ECN are developed at birth. We used resting-state fMRI data collected from preterm infants before (gestational age at 34.2 ± 2.0 weeks, N = 73) or at term-equivalent age (TEA, 40.9 ± 2.1 weeks, N = 73), and term infants (41.2 ± 1.7 weeks, N = 282) from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), and adults (22–36 years, N = 176) from the Human Connectome Project 1200, as a reference group to investigate these questions. We calculated the within- and between-network functional connectivity (FC) in DMN, DAN and ECN and captured their internal structure using hierarchical clustering analysis for each group. We found: 1) Infants did not exhibit higher within- relative to between-network FC in DMN and DAN until TEA, suggesting that these networks are underdeveloped before TEA. 2) The three networks were already developed in infants born at TEA. However, they were less cohesive and more atypical in their nodal structure than the adult networks. 3) Infants did not show lower FC in the DMN-DAN pairing relative to other pairings until TEA, suggesting the third trimester is a key period of the development of this reciprocal relationship. 4) Birth at or prior to TEA differentially impacted to the development of these networks and their relationship.

recCV8ivYpFck5YGh,Voluntary temporal attention affects the timing reliability of visual cortical responses,"[Goal] Visual attention fluctuates across both space and time. Voluntary temporal attention is the goal-directed prioritization of visual information at specific points in time. Temporal attention selectively improves perceptual sensitivity at attended times. Here, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying these perceptual improvements using MEG. We assessed how voluntary temporal attention affects the timing reliability of human visual cortical responses. 

[Methods] Observers performed an orientation discrimination task. On each trial, two grating targets (T1 and T2) appeared sequentially at the fovea for 100 ms, separated by a 300 ms stimulus onset asynchrony. A precue tone (75% validity) instructed observers to attend to T1 or T2. A response cue tone after the targets instructed them to report the orientation (CW/CCW) of either T1 or T2. Thus, on each trial, one target was attended and the other was unattended. The targets were embedded in 20 Hz flickering noise. The flicker generated a 20 Hz steady state visual evoked field (SSVEF) response in visual cortex, which served as a probe of visual cortical responses throughout the trial. We used a wavelet analysis to measure 20 Hz stimulus-locked oscillations across time. We calculated the intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) of the SSVEF signal, which indexes neural timing reliability. 

[Results and Conclusion] Temporal attention improved orientation discrimination performance, more for T1 than T2. Each target was followed by a brief change in ITPC, which we call the evoked ITPC response. Temporal attention increased the magnitude of the evoked ITPC response for T1 but not T2. In conclusion, voluntary temporal attention affected the timing reliability of the T1 response.",Rachel Denison,"Rachel N.

recCWf42QLQECEUnm,Coexistence of fast and slow gamma oscillations in one population of inhibitory spiking neurons,"Oscillations are a hallmark of neural population activity in various brain regions with a spectrum covering a wide range of frequencies. Within this spectrum γ oscillations have received particular attention due to their ubiquitous nature and their correlation with higher brain functions. Recently, it has been reported that gamma oscillations in the hippocampus of behaving rodents are segregated in two distinct frequency bands: slow and fast. These two gamma rhythms correspond to different states of the network, but their origin has been not yet clarified. Here we show theoretically and numerically that a single inhibitory population can give rise to coexisting slow and fast gamma rhythms corresponding to collective oscillations of a balanced spiking network. The slow and fast gamma rhythms are generated via two different mechanisms: the fast one being driven by the coordinated tonic neural firing and the slow one by endogenous fluctuations due to irregular neural activity. We show that almost instantaneous stimulations can switch the collective gamma oscillations from slow to fast and vice versa. Furthermore, to draw a connection with the experimental observations, we consider the modulation of the gamma rhythms induced by a slower (theta) rhythm driving the network dynamics. In this context, depending on the strength of the forcing and the noise amplitude, we observe phase-amplitude and phase-phase coupling between the fast and slow γ oscillations and the theta forcing. Phase-phase coupling reveals on average different theta-phase preferences for the two coexisting γ rhythms joined to a wide cycle-to-cycle variability.",Hongjie  Bi,"Hongjie Bi, Université de Cergy-Pontoise, France, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Japan; Marco Segneri, Université de Cergy-Pontoise, France; Matteo di Volo, Université de Cergy-Pontoise, Information et Complexité, France; Alessandro Torcini, Université de Cergy-Pontoise, France.",Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (grid.250464.1),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-28 09:00:00+00:00,2020-10-28 09:15:00+00:00,
recCZFN8lYor0Y3Z9,Differential effect of auditory and visual associative cues on perceptual inference,"Background: It is a widely held assumption that the brain performs perceptual inference by combining sensory information with prior expectations, all being weighted by their uncertainty. It has been shown that priors influencing perception of ambiguous stimuli can be manipulated with associative learning. Here, we investigate the differential effect of auditory vs. visual associative cues on visual motion perception and we also examine the reliability of individual differences.

Methods: Healthy individuals (N=29; 14 men, age[SD]=26.6[5.5]) performed a perceptual inference task twice with a one-week delay. They indicated the perceived direction of illusory motion of dot pairs (640 trials). A visuo-acoustic cue preceded the target stimulus and probabilistically predicted the direction of the motion. In 30% of the trials, motion direction was ambiguous, and in half of these trials, the auditory and the visual dimension of the cue predicted opposing directions. Cue-stimulus contingency could change every 40 trials. 

Results: Responses were slower to ambiguous, relative to non-ambiguous stimuli. The impact of associative learning on perceptual decisions was evidenced by slower responses to less predictable, relative to more predictable non-ambiguous stimuli and by the increased rate of cue-congruent decisions on ambiguous trials. Importantly, when the visual and the auditory dimensions of the cue predicted conflicting directions of motion on ambiguous trials, participants made more decisions congruent with the prediction of the acoustic dimension. Furthermore, all the above effects had substantial inter-individual variability which showed high test-retest reliability (rs > 0.6).

Discussion: Overall, priors based on auditory information seem to have a stronger weight during the perception of illusory visual motion, although the data suggests large and stable differences in perceptual learning and/or decision making. Computational modelling combined with neuroimaging could allow testing hypotheses regarding the potential mechanisms causing these behavioral effects (e.g. characteristics of visual vs. auditory processing, attention and uncertainty).",Zsófia Pálffy,"Bertalan Polner PhD, Department of Cognitive Science, Budapest University of Technology and Economics; Kinga Farkas MD PhD, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Semmelweis University",Budapest University of Technology and Economics (grid.6759.d),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Interactive talk,2020-10-30 12:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 12:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/y3nKmUua3Ik
recCZJlnQZwliojm5,Neural similarity in BOLD response and multi-unit recordings,"One fundamental question is what makes two brain states similar. For example, what makes the activity in visual cortex elicited from viewing a robin similar to a sparrow? There are a number of possible ways to measure similarity, each of which makes certain conceptual commitments. In terms of information processing in the brain, interesting questions include whether notions of similarity are common across brain regions and tasks, as well as how attention can alter similarity representations. With multi-unit recordings, additional questions like the importance of spike timings can be considered. We evaluated which of several competing similarity measures best captured neural similarity. One technique uses a decoding approach to assess the information present in a brain region and the similarity measures that best correspond to the classifier’s confusion matrix are preferred. Across two published fMRI datasets, we found the preferred neural similarity measures were common across brain regions, but differed across tasks. In considering similarity spaces derived from monkey multi-unit recordings, we found that similarity measures that took into account spike timing information best recovered the representational spaces. In both fMRI and multi-unit data, we found that top-down attention, which highlighted task relevant stimulus attributes, had the effect of stretching neural representations along those axes to make stimuli differing on relevant attributes less similar. These effects were captured by a deep convolutional network front-end to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that tracked changes in task context and whose representations stretched in a task-driven manner that paralleled patterns of neural similarity changed with task context.",Sebastian Bobadilla-Suarez,"Marilena Lemonari, UCL; Scott L.

recCZex1rwJWpEi8J,The role of Kv2 and Nav1.6 in Adaptive Firing in Place Fields within the CA1 region of the Hippocampus: A Computational and Experimental Approach,"Objective: The hippocampus is an area of the brain important in learning and spatial navigation. Within the hippocampal CA1 region, some pyramidal cells function as place cells, firing preferentially when an animal is in an area of its environment, its place field. As an animal enters its place field, the sensory input creates a bump in excitatory synaptic input, that decreases as an animal leaves the place field. We simulate this as a triangular current ramp applied to the soma or proximal dendrites (~200 μm from the soma). In a familiar place field, CA1 pyramidal cells fire more on the up ramp than down ramp, even though the ramp is symmetric.  This phenomenon, adaptation, is more pronounced in the dendrites. Spike height also significantly decreases in the dendrites. Slow inactivation of the voltage gated sodium channel increases with distance from the soma along the apical dendrite. Our objective is to model this inactivation as a possible mechanism behind adaptation and decrease in spike height in the dendrites.

Methods: We inserted a five state Markov model of Nav1.6 into an existing multicompartmental model implemented in NEURON. We calibrated this model to fit the time, voltage and spatial dependencies of slow inactivation according to the literature and data from our experimental collaborators. We later updated this model with the addition of the voltage gated potassium channel Kv2.

Results: After inserting the Markov model into the existing multicompartmental model, our simulation results included doublets that were inconsistent with our experimental results, until the addition of Kv2. In line with this prediction, blocking Kv2 produced doublets in our experimental ramps. With the addition of Kv2 and the Nav1.6 Markov model, the model successfully simulates adaptive firing, which is more pronounced in the dendrites, and decreased spike height in the dendrites.

recCZm7Ddgilp6ORE,EEG signals during relative depth judgments: Effect of image display techniques ,"Different three-dimensional visualization technologies are developed to provide users with a high-quality experience. To identify the effect of new image display technique on user cognitive demands, one should assess depth perception and underlying neurophysiological processing of digital information. Whilst many fundamentally different three-dimensional image display techniques exist, the previous research has mainly focused on comparative assessment of brain activity in subjects viewing three-dimensional images and two-dimensional images leaving a gap in understanding the user cognitive demands associated with novel displays.  
In this study, we aimed to identify and compare the effects of image display techniques on the relative depth judgements. The third dimension of image was generated in two ways – stereoscopic technique and volumetric technique. The visual stimulus contained four constant angular size circles, one of which was demonstrated closer to the subject. The subject’s task was to identify the closest circle. Electroencephalography was employed to record the brain activity during the visual task. 
As a result, the relative depth judgments were fast and accurate for both image display techniques. The analysis of event related potentials showed a significant difference in late processing, but not in early processing. Specifically, the parietal lobe was more activated at 250-400 ms after the onset of three-dimensional visual stimulus comparing the stereoscopic visualization with volumetric visualization. Moreover, differences in the parietal lobe reflected in the event-related desynchronization of upper alpha oscillations. The considerably higher activity in the continuous waves of beta frequencies was observed in half of the participants. Based on the obtained results, we suggest that the depth perception and visual task completion might require a higher neural activity for the stereoscopic image viewing than for the volumetric image viewing.

recCfiyQK2VbX7L47,Temporal dynamics of neuronal responses in human visual cortex,"Cortical responses to visual stimuli exhibit complex temporal dynamics, including sub-additive temporal summation, adaptation, and slower dynamics for suboptimal stimuli. Multiple computational models have been proposed to account for these dynamics in several measurement domains, including single-cell recordings, psychophysics, and fMRI. It is challenging to compare these models because of differences in model form, test stimuli, and instrument. Here we present a new dataset that is well-suited to compare neural models of temporal dynamics. The dataset is from electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings of human visual cortex, which measures cortical population responses with high spatial and temporal precision. The stimuli were large, static contrast patterns that varied systematically in contrast and duration for single-pulse trials, and in inter-stimulus interval (ISI) for paired-pulse trials. Time-varying broadband responses were computed using the power envelope of the band-pass filtered voltage time course (50-170 Hz) recorded from 126 electrodes in total across eleven epilepsy patients, covering earlier (V1-V3) and higher-order (LO, TO, IPS) retinotopic maps. In all visual regions, the ECoG broadband responses show several non-linear features: peak response amplitude saturates with high contrast and long stimulus durations; response latency decreases with increasing contrast; and the response to a second stimulus is suppressed for short ISIs and recovers for longer ISIs. These non-linear response features were well predicted by a model consisting of a small set of canonical neuronal operations: linear filtering, rectification, exponentiation, and delayed normalization. These results demonstrate that a simple computational model captures a wide range of temporal and contrast-dependent neuronal dynamics at millisecond resolution.

The details of a model implemented in such a script might not be obvious to a reader not familiar with the simulator. When a researcher presents such a model in a publication, they will therefore rather describe it with text and equations. Creating such a description, however, is error-prone, since it is up to the researcher to make sure that it accurately presents the simulated model. We therefore propose that it would be very useful if the simulator itself could generate a model description automatically. Here we present a prototype of such a system for the Brian simulator. It is built on the same framework that powers Brian's code generation process and is therefore guaranteed to give results that are consistent with the actual simulation. The new model description framework provides a basic exporter that generates a machine-readable representation which abstracts away all the details of Brian's internal representations and takes care of more subtle issues such as the meaning of referred constants and the order of variable assignments. This exporter is meant to be used as a base for other types of exporters. As a proof of concept, we show an export to the Markdown format, providing a human-readable description of a model. Such a description can be useful to exchange with other researchers that are not familiar with the Brian simulator, as a basis for a model description shared as part of a publication or website, or simply as a means for debugging a model.

recD3DKhGtREJfR0V,Variability and stability of folding patterns across cortical development and evolution,"Folding patterns are very characteristic of different species. Most quantification methods focus, however, on the estimation of the degree of folding – the description of their pattern remaining mostly qualitative. We developed a method to generate folding graphs which summarise the folding pattern of an individual brain. We illustrate the application of our method by computing folding graphs for several different mammalian species, as well as throughout their development.
We manually segmented the cerebrum and reconstructed 3D surfaces for all specimens. Based on mean curvature, we built gyral skeletons for each specimen and several developmental stages. The lines in the skeleton represent the axis of each gyrus, providing information about their orientation and width. We then simplify these lines into a graph and represent the folding pattern as an adjacency matrix where each cell corresponds to an encounter point between 2 or more gyri. We finally flatten the gyral skeletons.
Here, we will illustrate the flat skeletons for different primate species and developmental stages for several of the species. The complexity of the folding patterns increases rapidly with increasing brain volume leading to the development of a shared pattern which emerges even across different branches of the phylogenetic tree. Similarly, decreases in brain volume lead to a simplification of the folding pattern which occurs in a similar manner across different branches. A first comparison of folding patterns using graph edit distance leads to a clustering of species which reflects their brain volume more than a clade-specifc pattern.
Fold graphs can become a useful complement to estimations of the degree of folding, and provide a new perspective on the study of phylogenetic diversity.

recD3bb7MMGGRGaS4,Temporal dynamics in Drosophila taste coding influence synaptic plasticity,"The taste system ensures that animals consume nutritious foods and avoid ingesting toxins. Taste also modulates responses to other stimuli; for example, animals learn to avoid cues that are associated with bitter taste. The timing of neural activity is a key feature of neural encoding in many systems, but few studies have investigated the temporal dynamics of taste responses. Using calcium imaging, we found that Drosophila taste sensory neurons show striking differences in their response dynamics. Most classes of taste neurons show a sustained response throughout the stimulus presentation that rapidly diminishes upon stimulus removal. However, some bitter-sensing neurons show strong, transient responses at both the onset and offset of the stimulus. Moreover, with repeated bitter stimulation the onset response rapidly habituates while the offset response remains strong.

We observed the same bitter response dynamics in a set of downstream neurons, the PPL1 dopaminergic neurons (DANs). PPL1 DANs innervate the mushroom body, the learning and memory center of the fly brain, and mediate aversive olfactory learning. Studies have shown that PPL1 DANs are activated by aversive stimuli and drive learning by inducing synaptic depression at synapses onto mushroom body output neurons. Unexpectedly, we found that repeatedly pairing odor with bitter taste induced synaptic potentiation, not depression, at these synapses. However, synaptic depression could be induced by pairing odor with bitter removal. By combining calcium imaging with optogenetic stimulation to mimic PPL1 DAN activity, we found that these unexpected plasticity effects could be explained by the combination of two factors: 1) intrinsic timing rules that govern mushroom body plasticity, and 2) the dominance of the bitter offset response during repeated bitter exposure. These results demonstrate the importance of taste response dynamics and reveal unexpected complexity in how dopaminergic modulation drives plasticity in the primary learning center of the fly.",Anita Devineni,"Julia U.

recD4TdbZUVmYOUvp,Modeling the temporal dynamics of neurons in the IT cortex,"Understanding the neural mechanism of image processing in the visual brain is one of the main efforts in system neuroscience. The ventral stream is thought to function as a series of hierarchical stages that encode visual information increasingly in successive cortical areas. Recent electrophysiological studies have been suggested that the early and late phases of neural response encode multiple levels of hierarchical abstractions, i.e. an earlier representation of mid-level categories in the IT responses compared with superordinate-level and subordinate-level categories. However, the neural mechanism of this temporal category representation at multiple levels is poorly understood. To address this, we applied a combination of convolutional neural networks and a partial least squares regression (PLS) model to predict firing rates of IT neurons in response to the stimuli. To train a model, in the first phase, the feature vectors of images are extracted from a convolution neural network. Then, the feature vectors used as input to  PLS regression to predict the dynamics of neural response. We found that the predicted firing rates are highly correlated with the neuron’s actual firing rates. Furthermore, the encoding of predicted neural responses illustrated an earlier representation of mid-level category representation. The suggested model proposes a neural mechanism for temporal dynamics of category representation in the IT cortex. Moreover, the trained model can be applied to extract informative feature vectors for machine vision applications.

recD4yHRYmkqxWfwP,The Nuclear GAPDH-HMGB cascade in cortical microglia regulates cognitive flexibility,"Glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a key enzyme in glycolysis. Beyond its fundamental role in metabolism, GAPDH can get post-translationally modified in response to cellular stressors and subsequently translocate to nuclei to exert transcriptional control [the nuclear GAPDH (N-GAPDH) cascade]. We hypothesized that this cascade might play a critical role linking stress and behavior.

In this study, we discovered a novel mechanism that controls the response of microglia to stress through the N-GAPDH cascade and regulates animal adaptive behavior. Specifically, activation of the N-GAPDH cascade solely in cortical microglia and cognitive inflexibility were observed in a Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mouse model. Such cognitive deficits were blocked through pharmacological treatment or microglia-specific genetic intervention targeting the initial steps of the N-GAPDH cascade. To understand how the N-GAPDH cascade in microglia causes the cognitive deficits, we performed a ChIP-Seq analysis against N-GAPDH using ex-vivo microglia from the LPS-treated mice. We found upregulation of High-mobility group-box (HMGB) that can be secreted from microglia and binds to N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors on glutamatergic neurons, causing their hyperactivation which turns to cognitive deficits. In summary, this study defined a new mechanism of microglia-neuron interaction though which stress-activated immune cells regulates neural system via a key metabolic molecule, GAPDH. 

On-going studies: The ChIP-Seq analysis further revealed that the N-GAPDH cascade transcriptionally regulated the expression of GAPDH by itself and controlled proteostasis in microglia in a cell autonomous manner. The relevance of the N-GAPDH cascade in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (in particular monocytes) is under study in order to find possible molecular based biomarkers to predict behavioral inflexibility in the clinic. Among those candidates, we found autofluorescence reflects the activation of the N-GAPDH cascade in preclinical studies. Using a cohort of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls we found cellular autofluorescence in blood cells negatively correlates with behavioral flexibility.

recD9ZN1h5yBBkrs4,Prediction of Human Intelligence from Time-Resolved Brain Connectivity,"Spontaneous interactions between brain regions contain pertinent information about the neural bases of human behavior and cognition. Previous studies predicting cognitive abilities like intelligence have mostly focused on time-averaged (static) brain connectivity, derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Recent work decomposed dynamic brain connectivity into states of high and low co-fluctuation and demonstrated that only a small fraction of high co-fluctuation states is sufficient to approximate the general structure of the brain’s functional network architecture. Of note, such high co-fluctuation states have been shown to capture information that uniquely identifies individuals suggesting their relevance for stable individual differences in behavior and thought. Here, we use fMRI resting-state data (N = 281) to test whether the 5% of time points that index the moments of highest co-fluctuation can predict individual levels of general intelligence (WASI, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence). To this aim, we developed the Covariance Maximizing Eigenvector-Based Prediction framework (CMEP) that combines eigendecomposition-based feature construction with cross-validated ElasticNet prediction. The constructed features identify brain-wide patterns of network interactions reflecting a linear relationship between functional brain states and individual variations in intelligence. Surprisingly, functional connectivity reconstructed from highest co-fluctuation states could not reliably predict intelligence (correlation observed vs. predicted IQ scores: r = 0.14; p = 0.06). In contrast, functional connectivity reconstructed from the remaining 95% time points (excluding highest co-fluctuations) yields a significant prediction of intelligence (r = 0.38; p < 0.001). Finally, we reveal a different strategy for selecting critical time points and show that significant prediction of intelligence is indeed possible with only 5% resting-state fMRI data.

recDCdrsQr5CTVlvN,The influence of active removal from working memory on serial dependence,"Flexible control of the contents of working memory (WM), necessary for many aspects of behavior, includes the ability to remove no-longer-relevant information. Although simply withdrawing attention is one likely mechanism, many empirical results suggest that it is possible to actively remove information from working memory. We tested evidence for a specific mechanism for active removal: modulating the gain of the sensory channels that encode the stimulus-specific features (Lorenc et al., 2020; an efficient coding mechanism (c.f., Fritsche et al., 2020)). Subjects performed paired doublets of trials, the first being multi-item WM with retrocuing and updating, the second being 1-item delayed recall, with measures of serial dependence of the latter on various items from the former as the primary dependent variable of interest. The first trial of each doublet presented two sample Gabor patches, followed by a retrocue that implicitly designated the uncued item as an irrelevant memory item (IMI). Next a third item was presented, and finally memory for either the cued or the third item was tested. The critical manipulation was whether or not the third item was presented at the same location at which the IMI has appeared, with overlap between the two expected to prompt the active removal of the IMI from WM, whereas nonoverlap might require nothing more than the withdrawal of attention. Results indicated that whereas the IMI exerted the attractive bias on 1-item delayed recall in the no-overlap condition (consistent with a withdrawal of attention), but a repulsive bias in the overlap condition. Because repulsive serial dependence effects have been attributed to an efficient encoding mechanism (Fritsche et al., 2020), this result suggested the active removal of information from WM could be implemented by modulating the gain of the sensory channels that encode the features of IMI.",Jiangang Shan,"Jiangang Shan, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Bradley R.

recDLql4BFEvSDIsD,Oscillatory entrainment mechanisms and anticipatory predictive processes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD),"ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition that has striking effects on social communication. A less studied family of symptoms that defines it includes rigidity of routine, inflexibility of behavior and an intense desire for sameness. Studies have shown that sensory perception in this population is not flexibility adjusted to changes in the environment, and that their behavior is not influenced by prior knowledge or contextual cues. As of today, little is known about the neuronal substrates that are involved. 
Using EEG on children with ASD, we found that neuronal oscillations are less in-synch with the visual periodic pictures, and show an altered anticipation for them, compared to controls. In a subsequent study on ASD adults, visual / auditory stimuli are presented in rhythmic patterns with different degrees of predictive value. Preliminary results show reduced entrainment to the central stimulation rhythm in the ASD group, in conditions where this rhythm is jittered. 
We propose a neural account for the ASD phenomenology of rigidity and insistence on sameness, which could be crucial to the application of a behavioral training for children with ASD. Moreover, it can open a window for future investigation on the associated cellular and sub-cellular physiological mechanisms involved in it.

recDQHxpCXfuvWPSo,Transferring generalized neural decoders across participants and recording modalities,"Advances in neural decoding have enabled brain-computer interfaces to perform increasingly complex and clinically-relevant tasks. However, such decoders are often tailored to specific participants, days, and recording sites, limiting their practical long-term usage. Therefore, a fundamental challenge is to develop generalized neural decoders that can robustly train on pooled, multi-participant data and fine-tune to new participants. Here we introduce  HTNet, a decoder architecture that fuses deep learning with neural signal processing insights. Specifically, HTNet augments a pre-existing convolutional neural network decoder with two innovations: (1) a Hilbert transform that computes spectral power at data-driven frequencies and (2) a layer that projects electrode-level data into predefined brain regions. This projection is critical for intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG), where electrode locations are not standardized and vary widely across participants. We trained HTNet to decode arm movements using pooled ECoG data from 11 of 12 participants, testing performance on unseen ECoG or scalp electroencephalography (EEG) participants; these pretrained models were later fine-tuned to each test participant. We show that HTNet significantly outperformed state-of-the-art decoder accuracies by 8.5% when tested on unseen ECoG participants and by 14.5% when tested on unseen participants that used a different recording modality (EEG). We then used transfer learning and fine-tuned these trained models to unseen participants, even when limited training data was available. Importantly, we fine-tuned trained HTNet decoders with as few as 50 events and still achieved decoding performance approaching that of randomly-initialized decoders trained on hundreds of events. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HTNet extracts interpretable, neurally-relevant features. By generalizing to new participants and recording modalities, robustly handling variations in electrode placement, and fine-tuning with minimal data, HTNet can be used across a broader range of neural decoding applications than current state-of-the-art decoders.",Steven Peterson,"Steven M Peterson, University of Washington; Zoe Steine-Hanson, University of Washington; Nathan Davis, University of Washington; Rajesh P N Rao, University of Washington; Bingni W Brunton, University of Washington",University of Washington (grid.34477.33),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-27 16:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 16:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/lcmBI4a9v_4
recDRwLaHjoCw6yhf,Peripheral cardiovascular hypersensitivity and blunted ventromedial prefrontal cortex reactivity in generalized anxiety disorder,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by apprehensive expectation of aversive bodily states, yet the link between GAD and autonomic arousal is unclear. We investigated potential cardiorespiratory interoceptive dysfunction in GAD using peripheral adrenergic stimulation with the adrenaline analog isoproterenol (0.5, 2 mcg) and saline during BOLD fMRI. Infusions were randomized and double-blinded. GAD (n=29) and HC (n=29) females, matched for age and BMI, rated cardiorespiratory sensation intensity throughout infusions using a dial. Chronotropic dose 25 estimates, an indirect measure of beta-adrenergic receptor sensitivity, showed that GADs exhibited greater heart rate (HR) responses to isoproterenol than HCs (p=0.04, Cohen’s d=0.55). Linear mixed-effects (LME) models for HR revealed this effect to be driven by the 0.5 mcg dose (p=0.002). Sensation ratings were also amplified at this dose (p<0.01). GADs retrospectively reported heightened anxiety across doses (p≤0.005), and heightened heartbeat (p<0.001) and breathing (p≤0.001) intensity at 0.5 mcg. GADs showed significantly attenuated neural responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) at 0.5 mcg relative to HCs (p<0.05 corrected). We corroborated these results in separate region-of-interest time-series analyses using multivariate Functional Principal Components Analysis (mFPCA), which characterizes the major modes of variation around smoothed mean trajectories. LMEs on coefficients obtained from the mFPCA showed time-course differences for GADs during the 0.5 mcg dose for HR (p=0.02), dial ratings (p=0.01), and BOLD responses from salience and default mode network regions, including the vmPFC (p=0.01). In summary, adrenergic stimulation in GAD females revealed evidence of autonomic hypersensitivity, which was accompanied by heightened cardiorespiratory interoception, anxiety, and attenuated neural responses in the vmPFC, a region important for self-referential processing and visceromotor control. Our results provide strong evidence that, in females, 1) GAD constitutes deficits in appraisal and regulation of sympathetic arousal, and 2) both autonomic and central nervous systems contribute to interoceptive pathophysiology in GAD.",Adam Teed he/him/his,"Maria Puhl, Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma; Rachel C.

There are methods to subsample the tree of possibilities to make the calculation tractable in such cases. These include Monte-Carlo tree search and variants like UCB1. In this talk, we present the results of a different strategy motivated by recent work in our group that indicates where plan-based action selection is most useful. Consider a discretized space being planned over, with some cells containing barriers/occlusions/gateways, and other cells being open. Rather than each possible position in a space being considered during planning, the agent plans over locations in the space where there is a transition in the graph connectivity. In the real world these transitions include barriers, corridors, gateways, and bottlenecks where the prey can hide. These locations are where the largest potential reward value changes happen. To bridge between these locations during plan execution, shortest path trajectories are calculated. This method enables planning a number of steps ahead that is several orders of magnitude larger than planning where every location of the space is considered. We present results in an idealized predator-prey scenario where we show that this method provides similar survival rates for the prey as UCB1 but with far fewer compute steps.

recDilZm3WGaBM35s,De-noising EMG using dynamical systems models of muscle population activity,"Precise coordination of the activity of groups of muscles is critical for motor function. However, a major barrier to understanding how the brain coordinates muscle activation is that recordings of electromyographic (EMG) activity from muscles are a noisy measure of muscle activation, making them difficult to evaluate on a moment-to-moment basis. The standard approach to processing EMG (i.e., rectification and smoothing) treats high frequency features in EMG signals as noise. Here, we describe dynamically-estimated EMG (deEMG), a method to de-noise EMG signals recorded simultaneously from multiple muscles. Our working model is that, during movement, the coordinated activity of muscles is the output of an underlying dynamical system, and that accurately modeling these dynamics using recurrent neural networks might substantially de-noise EMG, while preserving any complex, high-frequency components that are present in multiple muscles. We tested deEMG using intramuscular EMG recorded from 12 muscles from two model systems: (1) rat hindlimb muscles during locomotion and (2) monkey forearm muscles during an isometric center-out wrist force task. deEMG had significant advantages over standard smoothing. When applied to the rat data, the model’s nonlinear filtering properties produced single-trial representations of muscle activity that improved decoding of joint kinematics and preserved behaviorally-linked, high frequency EMG features that are suppressed by linear filters. Similarly, when applied to the monkey data, deEMG enabled more accurate prediction of measured forces and was substantially more informative about simultaneously-recorded motor cortical activity, suggesting that deEMG-inferred representations better reflect descending cortical commands. Additionally, deEMG revealed unexpected high frequency oscillations that correlated with oscillations in the recorded force data but were not apparent after standard smoothing. Ultimately, this method opens new avenues to studying the coordination of multiple muscles and their precise control by upstream brain areas.",Lahiru Wimalasena,"Jonas F.

There is no effective pharmaceutical drug that can palliate the social deficits caused by autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Oxytocin (OT), a neuropeptide, promotes pro-social behaviors making it a potential candidate for pharmacological treatment. Melanotan II (MTII) is a compound of interest that evokes endogenous OT release in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Regions of the social salience network (SSN) coordinate to process social information. MTII primes PVN to release OT throughout the (SSN). MTII combined with social stimulus, increases OT releases throughout the SSN. MTII- induced pattern of brain activation was investigated across the SSN with social exposure. Twenty-four prairie voles received MTII doses ranging from 0.1 nmol to 1 pmol into lateral ventricles and were exposed to social or non-social stimuli. To observe activation, immunolabelling was performed to label for OT expression and c-FOS, an immediate early gene protein used as proxy for neuronal activation. Behavioral side effects were observed: stretching, spinning, scratching, grooming, and ambulating. Decrease in side effects was observed with decrease in dosage. To analyze c-FOS expression an online machine learning program, DeepFLaSH was used. Results suggested no behavioral difference between vehicle and 1 pmol group making it a viable dose for future experiments. However, a quantitative analysis of c-FOS expression suggested there was no significant difference in expression at different doses. We concluded the behavioral differences observed at different doses were not correlated with increased c-FOS expression in the PVN. In future, we will examine MTII-induced activation of c-FOS expression in other regions of the SSN.

Scientists repeat the sensory conditions in which a choice is made so as to statistically sample an underlying expectation. The statistics of a process can be deduced in this manner if it is ergodic, that is if a collection of samples at one time captures the dynamics of the process at all times. Popular models of choice treat expectation as ergodic within a trial, subject to change between trials. We analyzed the temporal dynamics of expectation in a free choice saccade task, and found that expectations evolved within as well as between trials. We embedded reinforcement learning into an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process to model expectation as a continuous dynamic. The OU process reaches a steady-state at a predicted time of choice, rather than at true sensory onset, accounting for empirical history effects in anticipatory behaviour. The model suggests that expectations should be understood as a predictive dynamic interacting with an environment, rather than a stationary parameter locked to choice onset.

As  the  number  of  possible  contexts  is  virtually  infinite,  making parallel  circuits  for  each  context unfeasible, a crucial question is what architectures permit implementation of multiple related computations within a single circuit.  Here, we address this question in the specific case of the circuitry of the visual system, focusing on the role of distinct cell types in context integration of visual scenes.  We show that a population of inhibitory neurons, the VIP cells, can enable such context integration — defined as the integration of feedforward and surround information across visual space — in two different contexts, in which the viewer is static vs.  moving.  Moreover, the VIP population is efficient, requiring only a relatively small number of neurons to switch contexts.

Mathematics ability(MA) is an important indicator of human intelligence (Chen et al., 2017). Basic arithmetic calculations and related numeracy skills are essential part of the normal brain operation (Docherty et al., 2010). The genetic complexities of MA might explain the fundamentals of general intelligence both at genetic and neurobiological level. On the other hand, American Psychiatric Association (1994) defines mathematics disability(MD) as receiving arithmetic scores at least 2 years below expected grade level.

We recorded populations of neurons in the barrel cortex, which processes whisker input, to identify how it encoded the corresponding sensorimotor variables. Neurons across the cortical layers encoded touch, whisker motion, and task-related signals.

However, methodological challenges have limited the ability to expand the DDM to test new decision-making strategies.  Specifically, the complexity of defining new models and the time required to fit them to data have prevented widespread exploration of variants on the DDM.  Additionally, the DDM can only represent a limited set of experimental designs.

Here, we describe our recent work on the generalized drift-diffusion model (GDDM), a framework for building and fitting DDM extensions, and a software package (PyDDM) which implements the framework (Shinn et al., 2020, eLife).  Our framework makes previously intractable high-throughput approaches possible with a 100-fold or more speedup compared to standard methods.  It also makes it easy to reuse different aspects of these DDM extensions, facilitated by our growing online database of model mechanisms (https://pyddm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/index.html) to promote reproducibility and open science.

Our framework allows experimentalists to fit models to more complex experimental paradigms, and theorists to conveniently formulate models and efficiently fit them with the latest methodology.  We demonstrate this flexibility by analyzing a sophisticated decision-making task using a high-throughput approach to explore decision-making strategies.  We presented monkeys with a perceptual decision-making task with noisy evidence extended over time that included both timing and reward manipulations.  Our modeling approach discovered the key characteristics of decision-making strategies which can account for the reward and timing biases exhibited by the monkeys (Shinn et al., 2020, J Neurosci).

recEHYLOH1VM0PwxR,Altered hippocampal neural dynamics in a rodent model of chronic stress ,"Adverse effects of chronic stress include anxiety, depression, and learning and memory deficits. Some of these deficits are mediated by stress-induced impaired hippocampal functionality at multiple levels of neural organization including dendritic shrinkage and neurogenesis and impaired synaptic plasticity. In agreement, studies in awake behaving rodents have reported that chronic stress alters place cell activity and disrupts global remapping which is the generation of distinct representations (place maps) across different surroundings. Surprisingly, it is not known if and how chronic stress alters hippocampal information processing during offline behaviour states, including quiet wakefulness/sleep, during which information consolidation takes place during sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs or ripples), high frequency (100-200 Hz) oscillatory events  in the CA1 region.
Here, we employed tetrode recordings in mice and subjected them to chronic immobilization stress (CIS), a well-established rodent model of chronic stress and assessed pyramidal cell activity and SPW-Rs in the dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus. Contrary to our expectations, we noticed a net decrease in pyramidal cell activity during the first exposure to a stress compared to the prior quiet wakefulness/sleep state. We also noticed lower firing rates and decreased participation by pyramidal cells during SPW-Rs, though pyramidal cell co-activity was enhanced during stress exposure. Interestingly, after repeated exposure to same stress, some of these stress-phenotypes were noticed during the rest-state on the last day of CIS, when no overt stress was delivered. These data indicate that repeated exposure to stress alters hippocampal neural dynamics and that disrupted ripple-spike interactions may underlie the impaired learning observed in chronically stressed subjects.

However, this result did not generalize to other features, such as spatial frequency (Baltaretu et al., J Vis, 2016). We hypothesized that the fundamental difference between these results was the detection of transsaccadic changes in object orientation vs. identity. To test this, we used a double-dissociation fMRI task. Participants fixated a small cross 15.4° left or right of centre, where an object was subsequently presented (rectangle, barrel-shaped, or hourglass-shaped), oriented at ±45° from vertical. After this, the fixation cross either remained in the same position (Fixation condition) or shifted to the other side (Saccade condition). Then, either the same object would appear with the opposite orientation (Orientation change condition) or one of the other two objects would appear at the same orientation (Identity change condition). Button press was used to indicate whether object identity or orientation had changed. Results indicate that cortical modulations were larger for saccades (than fixations) when orientation changed in medial early occipital regions (e.g., V1) extending into later occipitotemporal regions. Activation for changes in identity were larger for saccades (than fixations) for identity change in regions similar to those for orientation change, but also in medial parietal regions (e.g., precuneus and superior parietal lobule). When looking for a feature (Orientation > Identity) change specifically in cortical regions showing a Saccade > Fixation preference, we found this activation within medial occipital/occipitotemporal cortex extending toward the border with parietal regions as well. These preliminary results suggest that differences in object features that occur across saccades also appear at the cortical level (largely within medial occipital cortex, extending both towards parietal and temporal cortex). Further controls will be applied to confirm that these results are task- and feature-specific. ",Bianca Baltaretu,"Bianca R.

The Drosophila connectome has been studied extensively in the literature and modeled as a complex network to understand the relationship between brain functionality and animal behavior. Similar to human connectomes, Drosophila connectomes also exhibit modular structure despite their relatively small sizes where cluster-like regions in the brain can be further divided into subclusters based on functional or structural similarity. Built upon an automatic Gaussian mixture modeling technique, we introduce a hierarchical stochastic blockmodel clustering algorithm which recursively clusters a network to obtain sub-clusters that can be approximated as stochastic blockmodels. We demonstrate the hierarchical structure of the mushroom body of Drosophila connectomes revealed by the proposed algorithm.

The standard view is that each consecutive item occupies a distinct slot in working memory. Instead, we formulate and test the alternative hypothesis that the human brain compresses the whole sequence using an abstract, language-like code that captures the numerical and geometrical regularities of the sequence at multiple nested levels. We exposed participants to spatial sequences of fixed length but variable regularity, and asked them to remember the sequence in order to detect deviants, while their brain activity was recorded using magneto-encephalography. Using multivariate decoders, each successive location could be decoded from brain signals, and upcoming locations could be decoded prior to their actual onset. Crucially, sequences with lower complexity, defined as the minimal description length provided by the formal language, and whose memory representation was therefore predicted to be more compressed, led to lower error rates and to increased anticipations. Furthermore, neural codes specific to the numerical and geometrical primitives of the postulated language could be detected, both in isolation and within the sequences. These results suggest that the human brain detects sequence regularities at multiple nested levels and uses them to compress long sequences in working memory.",Fosca Al Roumi,"Sébastien Marti, Liping Wang, Marie Amalric, Stanislas Dehaene",CEA Saclay (grid.457334.2),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 16:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 16:15:00+00:00,
recEdrJrUhkWJDaAK,Reconsolidation of a threat memory in humans: A highly demanding working memory task interfere the re-stabilization and its biases processing towards threat.,"Consolidated memories can be reactivated into a labile state by the presentation of a reminder. The reactivation of the memory trace is followed by a process of re-stabilization known as reconsolidation. In most of reconsolidation studies, a second task, with similar characteristics to those of the target memory, is used as an amnesic agent.
Anxiety manifest as a persistent and  generalized  defensive  system,  activated  when  predicted  aversive events  are  perceived  as a threat and uncertain. In laboratory, threat conditioning has been taken as the paradigm for assessing fear memories and anxiety related disorders. In the framework of the reconsolidation the idea that this process would allow to modify this type of maladaptive memories has been proposed. 
Here we aim to interfere the re-stabilization of an implicit aversive memory in humans using a high demanding working memory task, which aimed to overload this transient memory system. To reach such goal, we designed a 3 day protocol, and compared a trained threat conditioning group, that 24hs later had or not a reminder, or a fake working memory task; 48hs after, all 3 groups performed an extinction follow by a reinstatement and several tasks targeting cognitive bias towards threat. We revealed that the memory reconsolidation interference is effective for the implicit memory retention but not for the declarative memory. Finally, we showed how the interference reduced biased processing towards threat.

recEipRi0m9vQrjnb,Genetic link between impaired homeostatic plasticity and neurodevelopmental disorders,"Homeostatic plasticity is an evolutionarily conserved form of neuromodulation. It has been hypothesized that loss of homeostatic plasticity will make the nervous system more susceptible to disease. But, this has yet to be clearly demonstrated, particularly with respect to the homeostatic modulation of synaptic function in the central nervous system and brain disorders. To address this fundamental question, I use different model organisms (fly, mouse and IPSc-derived neurons) and combine genetic screening, electrophysiological and transcriptomic analysis methods. With this approach, I recently identified a novel class of autism-gene modifiers causing homeostatic plasticity to fail. This defines a model, where de novo risk mutations impair the robustness of neuronal activity when combined with the modifier mutations lurked in the genetic background. This validated approach helps us identify new genetic and molecular mechanisms, thereby providing a new framework for advancing our understanding of neurogenetic diseases. 
It seems plausible that restoring the buffering capacity of homeostatic plasticity could be broadly relevant to the treatment of neurological disorders of any genetic origin. In the central nervous system, several neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s, manifest impaired neuronal function before the onset of the neuronal degeneration. Thus, this is an important stage when neurons cope with genetic and environmental insults by engaging homeostatic protective mechanisms, thereby maintaining the functional well-being. Using mammalian models, my current and future research aims to generate mechanistic insights on how homeostatic plasticity is compromised in neurological disorders including neurodegenerative diseases, stroke and neurovascular abnormalities. With this information, I hope to develop interventional strategies that will boost the homeostatic capacity of the brain to stabilize the neuron and circuit function.

Collective oscillations emerge for sufficiently connected networks. Their origin is understood in terms of a recently developed mean-field model for sparse balanced neural networks. Collective oscillations are induced by irregular microscopic neural firing, due to balance. The same mechanism induces in balanced excitatory-inhibitory networks quasiperiodic collective oscillations.

Such alterations in executive control have been associated with a dysfunction of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), possibly linked to an alteration of dopamine (DA) transmission. However, preclinical data regarding the implication of DA signalling in executive control remain controversial. Here, we used a chemogenetic approach to selectively and reversibly inhibit DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and assess the effect on distinct components of goal-directed behavior using the outcome devaluation task that allows assessing the ability of animals to flexibly adapt goal-directed actions. 
We found that while inhibition of VTA-DA neurons during outcome devaluation had no effect, the same manipulation during reversal of the instrumental contingencies resulted in a deficit in a subsequent outcome devaluation test. Our data provide clear evidence regarding the implication of VTA-DA transmission in the capacity to flexibly adapt goal-directed behaviors. These findings support the idea that alteration of VTA-DA transmission could participate to the aetiology of cognitive symptoms in psychiatric disorders.

recEuETz3SgfDeU7y,"Accuracy, Confidence and Decision-time of Perceptual Decisions in Discrete vs Continuous Environment","In many cases, decisions require information integration from pieces of evidence with discrete time intervals. Yet, the neural mechanism underlying these decisions is uncertain.
This research has mainly concentrated on accuracy, confidence, and decision-time of double-pulse vs single-pulse stimulus. To inspect the concept, behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) data have been analyzed.
Accordingly, we applied a perceptual decision-making experiment using Random Dot Motions (RDM) paradigm. Participants had to indicate the predominant direction of motion of a cloud of moving dots (left or right) by saccadic eye movement to the chosen target after receiving one or two pulses of 120 ms of information. Both direction and strength of the motion changed trial by trial. Moreover, the interval of two pulses is selected randomly from 0, 120, 360, and 1080 ms. Healthy adult subjects were tested and meanwhile, we used a 32-channel amplifier for the EEG signal recording. Here, we searched for the relation of accuracy, confidence, decision-time, and their ERP (Event-related potential) characterizations in a more real-life like decision-making.
Results from behavioral and the ERP have shown that participants develop similar behavior but with some differences in the discrete vs continuous environment. Subjects’ performance and confidence were independent of the intervals up 1 s. However, unlike the confidence, accuracy improved considerably in double-pulse trials. Moreover, when participants had better accuracy, their decision-time (the time between response cue and saccadic response) decreased. Interestingly, the decision-time of single-pulse trials was significantly longer compared to double-pulse trials. The grand-average ERP results showed a peak observed around 300 ms after the stimulus offset. This peak was identified to be related to decision-making and significantly increased in faster decisions.
To summarize, it seems, along with the continuous environment, accuracy, confidence, and decision-time could be tracked from ERPs component during decision-making in a discrete environment.

Our work revealed a conserved cell type set containing three classes of region-invariant inhibitory neurons and two classes of region-specific excitatory neurons. This cell type set forms an archetypal cerebellar nucleus that was repeatedly duplicated to create new regions. In excitatory neurons, duplication was accompanied by divergence in gene expression and shifts in projection patterns (neofunctionalization). By contrast, inhibitory neurons maintained their gene expression signatures (isofunctionalization). Interestingly, the excitatory cell class that preferentially funnels information to lateral frontal cortices in mice becomes predominant in the massively expanded human Lateral CN.

Cocuzza et al. (2019) and Cole et al. (2013) administered a set of difficult tasks during fMRI and found between-network variability in functional connectivity was larger for the FPN than for ten other networks. A limitation of this study is that the tasks were designed to be difficult and engage the FPN. It is unclear, therefore, whether the FPN is a flexible hub in general, or only in the context of challenging tasks. We therefore tested whether the FPN is a flexible hub during naturalistic cognition. In Experiment 1, we analysed data from 15 people watching a movie, Forrest Gump (www.studyforrest.org). We found that the variability in connectivity of the FPN was no different from other networks, providing no evidence that it acted as a flexible hub. As naturalistic movies do not have a regular block design over which to examine changes in connectivity, we investigated a range of temporal window sizes from 30-240 s. The results generalised across these. However, it is possible that Forrest Gump engaged the FPN less than everyday life, and the dataset only has 15 subjects. In Experiment 2, therefore we analysed a larger dataset (n=647, www.cam-can.org) of people watching a suspenseful clip known to strongly engage the FPN (Naci et al., 2014). Again, we found that the FPN was no more flexible than other networks. These results suggest that during naturalistic cognition, the FPN does not act as a flexible hub any more than other networks in the brain, suggesting it is not a trait of the FPN, but rather just a state during sets of difficult tasks.",Chiara Caldinelli,"Rhodri Cusack, Trinity College Dublin",Trinity College Dublin (grid.8217.c),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-28 09:15:00+00:00,2020-10-28 09:30:00+00:00,

The Spatiotemporal dynamics of the synchrony in the spontaneous activity at different scales may carry information about the organization, circuitry of neuronal populations as well as the local processes and function of these circuits.
Here, to quantify the extent to which the dynamics of synchronous spontaneous activity predicts the neuroanatomical structure, we recorded local field potentials (LFP) and spiking activity of cluster of neurons in the somatosensory cortex of anesthetized rats in using a 10x10 microelectrode array.
We did the experiments on the somatosensory cortex of awake and anesthetized rodents (rats and mice). We calculated different measures of within and cross-frequency coupling (in terms of phase-phase, phase-amplitude, amplitude-amplitude coupling) in frequency bands of interest (<0.1 Hz, δ, θ, α, β, γ) between pairs of electrodes. We observed a gradual decrease in the strength of coupling with the distance between electrodes, especially at higher frequencies. Specifically, while the decline was not so evident for  <0.1 Hz and δ band, where the couplings varied insignificantly with distance, it became more profound for higher frequencies.
A multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) on the strength of couplings revealed the spontaneous activity predicts the position of electrodes. Applying machine learning based on T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) lead to similar findings.

Among them, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to control stem cell pluripotency, carcinogenesis, development and function of several tissues and organs. Although thousands of lncRNAs are expressed in adult mammalian brain in a highly patterned and specific manner, they remain poorly characterized and their roles in brain development have not yet been studied.
To tackle this question, we initially performed RNA-Seq analysis in the developing nervous system of mouse embryo. Based on this analysis, we identified many lncRNAs highly expressed in neural cells. We focused on lncRNAs, which are transcribed from genomic loci in close proximity with protein coding genes, encoding for critical transcription factors (TFs) in brain development. We hypothesized that these lncRNAs may be implicated in the regulation of neighboring TF genes.
To this end, we characterized the changes in the expression profiles of a number of lncRNAs-TF pairs during development of mouse brain. In this study, we further focused on the functional role of lncRNA TCONS_00034309 in the differentiation of neural stem cells and its relation to Tbr2 transcription factor by in vitro and in vivo overexpression and knock-down studies, using CRISPR-dCas9-KRAB Effector System.
To conclude, our data suggest critical roles for this lncRNA in neuronal differentiation and astrogliogenesis during brain development. Our study provides insights into the involvement of lncRNAs in organogenesis and shows how lncRNAs and protein-coding genes form regulatory networks with important functions in neural stem cells.

Thirty-eight healthy volunteers were assigned to one of two n-back groups for which WM load was different (2-back or 3-back). The experimental protocol comprised five counterbalanced conditions (0-back, n-back, pain, 0-back with pain, and n-back with pain). Pain and the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) were evoked by transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the sural nerve. Pain was significantly different between conditions, but not between n-back groups. Both the 0-back and n-back tasks reduced pain compared with pain alone, but the n-back task produced stronger pain inhibition compared with the 0-back task. NFR amplitude was significantly different between conditions but not between n-back groups. NFR was inhibited by the 0-back and n-back tasks, with no difference between the two tasks.

recFM8zyYIVaAwH9M,TRPA1 mediates cold nociception in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,"Nociception is the process by which an organism detects potentially harmful stimuli, driving behavioral responses that minimize incipient damage and promote organismal survival. Nociception relies on specialized channel receptors to detect these stimuli. Thermal nociception is responsible for the detection of noxious thermal stimuli at either extreme. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels play a crucial role in thermal nociception. However, there is little knowledge regarding how they mechanistically function in the regulation of noxious cold detection. TRPA1 is a polymodal channel that is conserved among vertebrates and invertebrates. Human TRPA1 has been implicated in mediating cold nociception, though its functional role in this process remains poorly understood. In Drosophila larvae, TRPA1 has been identified in polymodal nociceptive neurons in which it mediates chemical, high heat, and mechanical nociception. Recent neurogenomic analyses have identified TRPA1 expression in cold nociceptive sensory neurons (Class III; CIII), which suggests the possibility that this channel is also involved in the mediation of noxious cold detection. We have employed neurogenetic and behavioral techniques to dissect the role of TRPA1 in this process.
Whole animal TRPA1 mutants displayed a decrease in the characteristic contractile behavior in response to noxious cold temperatures; this was also observed in CIII-specific TRPA1 knockdown larvae. The requirement for TRPA1 was observed to be isoform specific. Optogenetic and behavioral analyses attested that TRPA1 is required for stimulus transduction rather than for action potential propagation. These findings provide insights into the underlying mechanism of cold detection while also raising questions regarding the polymodality and evolutionary role of TRPA1 channels. A better understanding of how the nociceptive phenomenon works could provide information that will aid in the development of better treatments for neuropathies, such as allodynia and hyperalgesia.

Firstly, we analyze the changes of EEG signal attenuation during motor imagery based on brain ERD phenomenon in a short period of time. Then we introduce the connectivity index of brain network based on graph theory, and discuss the influence of motor imagery training with or without neural feedback on the brain in three scales (single node scale, regional scale and whole brain scale).
Results: we found that the attenuation of EEG signal increased before and after motor imagery training whether or not nerve feedback was introduced. In the analysis of brain network, we found that the group with neural feedback has more obvious connectivity attenuation than the group without feedback.
Conclusion: we discussed the influence of BCI motor imagery with or without nerve feedback on brain from two aspects of ERD attenuation degree and ERP connectivity change. The results showed that the changes of indexes in the group with nerve feedback were more obvious and had more uniform trend attributes.

recFXjTDCKa4MqFDB,Weak signatures of audiovisual integration in mouse visual cortex,"Sensory cortices are increasingly thought to encode multisensory information. For instance, mouse primary visual cortex appears to be influenced by auditory inputs, which have been suggested to provide global inhibition or loudness and frequency specific information. However, sounds can also evoke behavioral responses. Such behavioral responses are now known to elicit neural activity across the brain. Thus, a potential confound between acoustic-related and movement-related activity could exist in multisensory studies. 

To investigate this issue, we measured the neuronal responses to natural movies and natural sounds in primary visual cortex (V1) using chronically implanted Neuropixels probes, thus recording the activity of hundreds of units.

First, we replicated previous results showing that sounds could evoke neural activity in V1. Sound-evoked responses were weak compared to video-evoked responses, but we could still significantly decode sound identity from population activity. Second, we observe that mice showed stereotypical, unsolicited behaviors in response to the sounds (from startling to more complex behaviors). Third, we show that removing movement-related activity from V1 population activity drastically reduced the responses to sounds. We conclude that a significant part of sound-evoked responses in V1 comes from indirect behavioral responses. Analysis of  changes in behavioral states is thus required for a careful characterization of auditory inputs to other sensory areas.

recFaMvSjryMyADVB,Neural modulation to direction and speaker in spatial multi-talker speech perception,"Humans can easily attend to the speech of a single talker in a mixture when the talkers are spatially separated. However, the neural mechanisms in the human brain that enable this ability are unclear. Specifically, it is not known how spatial separation affects the neural representation of the speech mixture, and how attention to either the location or the identity of a talker modulates the cortical response. We recorded intracranially from the human auditory cortex while subjects listened to spatial talkers either presented stand alone or in a mixture. We demonstrate that the neural encoding of phonemes is unaffected by the location of a talker presented in isolation, but narrows to the speech of the contralateral talker when presented in a mixture. Further, we show that attention to the spatial location and the talker identity have differential neural effects: attention to location modulates the overall baseline of neural response level while attention to talker identity modulates spectrotemporal selectivity.  Our results reveal how the human auditory cortex adjusts its neural tuning to enable listeners to attend to a talker in a spatially separated mixture, with implications for more accurate neurophysiological models of speech processing.",Prachi Patel,"Stephan Bickel,Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine; Jose L.

recFjullyNMyByYWA,Just-in-time computations by non-normal attractor dynamics in the prefrontal cortex,"Prefrontal cortex plays a central role in working memory maintenance. However, both the neural circuit mechanisms supporting this role and the precise computational objective underlying those mechanisms remain unknown. There have been two distinct proposals for what circuit dynamics may underlie memory maintenance: attractor dynamics giving rise to stable (persistent) activities, or feed-forward dynamics resulting in sequential (time varying) activities. Here, we analyze multiple datasets recorded in monkeys performing memory-guided saccade tasks across multiple task epochs. We show that neither of the previously proposed dynamical regimes alone accounts for experimentally observed neural activities, which instead display a rich combination of both sequential and stable dynamical motifs. Specifically, we found strongly dynamic transitions and hence sequential neural activity between different task epochs, together with stable activity during the delay epoch. We propose a novel unifying model that explains these puzzling findings. Our model combines two dynamical regimes that have hitherto been studied in isolation: non-normal feed-forward and attractor dynamics. Critically, in our model, optimal stimulus inputs are orthogonal to stable activity patterns, naturally producing strongly sequential stimulus-to-delay activity followed by stable delay activity, as seen in experiments. To understand the computational function of these dynamics, we trained recurrent neural networks for different objectives: to produce target activities at the time of the response, or throughout the delay period, or “just-in-time” (before the response, at the end of the delay period). Using these objectives, we respectively recovered either of the classical dynamics (sequential and stable), or their combination as observed in data. These results also generalised to neural responses recorded in a task involving distractor stimuli. In summary, our results identify a new class of non-normal attractor network dynamics, unifying sequential and stable motifs, and suggest that they serve a new functional objective: just-in-time computation.",Jake Stroud,"Jake P.

recFmf6K6xCLb9ylT,The left temporoparietal junction causally supports goal emulation in observational learning,"Humans learn from their own trial-and-error experience and observing others by inferring their goals. Previous studies have established a comprehensive neurocomputational account of the integration between directly earning and observational learning. Crucially, these studies have identified that bilateral temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is functionally associated with goal emulation. However, the causal role of bilateral TPJ in such processes remains unclear. Here, employing continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over bilateral TPJ as well as vertex, we tested how the TPJ supports goal emulation in a probabilistic reversal learning task (N = 31). Participants on each trial were first required to choose between two stimuli, after they have seen the choices from four other co-players, they had the opportunity to adjust their choices. A probabilistic reward was then delivered given their second choice. Notably, participants were instructed that they would play this game with four “intelligent computers,” and choices from those computers were in fact generated from our computational algorithm model (reported elsewhere), such that they matched with actual human behavior. To increase ecological validity, we used human faces to indicate each computer. Behavioral results indicate that disrupting activity in the left TPJ resulted in reduced choice switch probability and longer response time when confronted with opposing social information, as opposed to the right TPJ and vertex conditions. In addition, choice accuracy was declined when participants actually switched their choices in the left TPJ condition. No significant difference was observed between trials across stimulation sites. Computational modeling with the hierarchical Bayesian approach suggests that the corresponding parameter quantifying social information significantly decreased in the left TPJ condition, as compared to the right TPJ and vertex conditions. Together, our results provide evidence for the causal role of left TPJ in supporting goal emulation in human observational learning.",Lei Zhang (he/him),"Lei Zhang, University of Vienna; Farid I.

recFqv9JF0Yq7htcm,Remembrance of things practiced: Fast and slow learning in cortical and subcortical pathways,"The learning of motor skills unfolds over multiple timescales, with rapid initial gains in performance followed by a longer period in which the behavior becomes more refined, habitual, and automatized. While recent lesion and inactivation experiments have provided hints about how various brain areas might contribute to such learning, their precise roles and the neural mechanisms underlying them are not well understood. In this work, we propose neural- and circuit-level mechanisms by which motor cortex, thalamus, and striatum support motor learning. In this model, the combination of fast cortical learning and slow subcortical learning gives rise to a covert learning process through which control of behavior is gradually transferred from cortical to subcortical circuits, while protecting learned behaviors that are practiced repeatedly against overwriting by future learning. Together, these results point to a new computational role for thalamus in motor learning and, more broadly, provide a framework for understanding the neural basis of habit formation and the automatization of behavior through practice.

recFrA0r0TRhV4KDq,Automated Screening to Assist a Systematic Living Summary of Primary In Vivo Focal Cerebral Ischaemic Stroke Research,"Introduction: The failure to plan new research based on a systematic assessment of the existing literature is an important source of research waste. Systematic reviews of primary in vivo focal cerebral ischaemic stroke research have informed improvements in research quality and translation of findings to the clinic[1]. However, the process is time-consuming and, by completion, the results are often out of date. We aim to develop a workflow to automatically identify reports of this research to allow a systematic living summary of the literature[2].
Methods: We trained the machine-learning algorithm using a random sample of PubMed records from a search of terms relevant to focal cerebral ischaemia supplemented with relevant studies identified from previous systematic reviews[3]. In August 2020, we conducted a systematic search of PubMed and Embase and passed the unique studies through the algorithm to identify all primary in vivo focal cerebral ischaemic stroke research.
Results: Our random sample (N=4,000) identified 130 (3.3%) primary in vivo focal cerebral ischaemic stroke studies. We trained the machine-learning algorithm with 4,786 studies (4,000 random sample plus 786 identified from previous systematic reviews). The algorithm identified relevant studies with sensitivity at 95%, specificity at 98% and precision at 92%. Our systematic search of PubMed and Embase identified 752,494 unique studies duplicate removal. Of this, the algorithm identified 27,269 (3.6%) primary in vivo focal cerebral ischaemic stroke studies.
Conclusions: Automated screening of search results in systematic review will save substantial resources, especially where the yield of relevant studies is low. Preliminary machine-learning results suggest that this machine-learning algorithm is highly accurate in identifying primary in vivo focal cerebral ischaemic stroke research and could be used in an automated systematic living summary workflow curating such research.

recFtZFysYB3SsLfb,PREDICTING AGE IN 8-TO-24-MONTH-OLDS USING RESTING-STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY MRI,"Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) measured with functional MRI has been used to predict phenotypes such as chronological age and clinical diagnoses in typically and atypically developing adults and children. However, its utility for predicting phenotypes in infants and toddlers is less well-characterized. Here, we use fMRI data from the Baby Connectome Project sample to predict the age of 110 infants and toddlers age 8-24 months old using data collected during natural sleep. Successful prediction could provide initial evidence that rsFC in infancy is reliable and informative of chronological age, and thus potentially predictive of other measures of interest in this group such as language or motor development with age. Using 10-fold cross-validation, we trained and tested support vector regression (SVR) models to predict age-at-scan using whole-brain rsFC constructed from 333 cortical parcels. Models successfully predicted novel infants’ age with ±4.1 months error and predictive R2=0.32. To characterize the anatomy of predictive networks, we grouped connections into 11 infant-specific or 12 adult-defined canonical resting-state functional networks (e.g., the default mode network). We found that connections between regions of the same networks—i.e., within-network connections—predicted age as well as or better than the full functional connectome (RMSE=±4 months error and R2=0.35 for within-infant-network connections). Furthermore, control analyses confirmed that results are not driven by head motion. Looking ahead, the current findings can help characterize changes in functional brain organization across development and inform work predicting measures of cognitive development in infants.

recFxxD9QNcKnyqSO,Efferent and afferent estimates of hand location do not optimally integrate,"The central nervous system (CNS) can rely on at least two sources of information in order to localize limb position in the absence of vision: (1) proprioceptive afferents from receptors in the limb, and (2) an efference copy of the motor command used by the cerebellum to generate a prediction of sensory consequences. To produce a reliable, single estimate about the location of the limb, these two sources of information could be optimally integrated using Bayesian integration, or maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). While some work has been done to investigate whether the CNS optimally combines visual and proprioceptive cues, less is known for the integration of non-sensory signals for limb estimates (i.e. efferent signals) given the difficulty of isolating them from the ever-present proprioceptive afferent signals. Here, we use our new paradigm to isolate efferent-based estimates of hand position from proprioception, by having over 200 healthy participants, both younger and older adults (55+), localize their hand after actively reaching in a self-chosen direction (active localization), or after being passively moved by a robotic manipulandum (passive localization). We then investigated if estimates of hand location based on both efferent and afferent signals (active localization) are more precise than those based only on proprioception (passive localization). According to the MLE rule, or other straightforward Bayesian mechanisms, variance should be lower in the localization condition where two signals are combined (active localization; prediction and proprioception) and higher with only a single source of information (passive localization; proprioception only), but we found no evidence in support of this. Further, we looked at whether weaker proprioceptive priors lead to greater learning-induced shifts in hand localization as would be predicted by Bayesian (optimal) inference. But we did not find that noisier, highly variable estimates were more susceptible to larger proprioceptive recalibration following adaptation to a perturbation suggesting a non-Bayesian mechanism for integration. Together, these findings make it less likely that the CNS uses optimal integration to combine efferent-based predicted sensory consequences and proprioceptive afferents when estimating and updating the final limb position.",Maria Ayala,"Marius 't Hart, Denise Henriques",York University (grid.21100.32),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-29 21:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 21:30:00+00:00,
recFyMcuBJ98nEJgI,Conflict detection in a sequential decision task is associated with increased cortico-subthalamic coherence and prolonged subthalamic oscillatory response in the beta band,"Making accurate decisions often involves the integration of current and past evidence. Here we examine the neural correlates of conflict and evidence integration during sequential decision making. Patients implanted with deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes and age-matched healthy controls performed an expanded judgement task, in which they were free to choose how many cues to sample. Behaviourally, we found that while patients sampled numerically more cues, they were less able to integrate evidence and showed suboptimal performance. Using recordings of Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and local field potentials (in patients) in subthalamic nucleus (STN), we found that beta oscillations signalled conflict between cues within a sequence. Following cues that differed from previous cues, beta power in the STN and cortex first decreased and then increased. Importantly, the conflict signal in the STN outlasted the cortical one, carrying over to the next cue in the sequence. Furthermore, premotor cortico-subthalamic beta coherence increased during the initial power decrease. These results extend our understanding of cortico-subcortical dynamics of conflict processing, and do so in a context where evidence must be accumulated in discrete steps, much like in real life, leading to a more nuanced picture of conflict monitoring systems in the brain and potential changes due to disease.

recG90XGaNhFD4znY,Aiming evokes explicit motor adaptation,"In recent years it has become exceedingly clear that explicit learning plays an important role in motor adaptation. The most used method to measure explicit adaptation is aiming: participants are asked to indicate what angle, relative to the target, they will aim at for their next reach. While useful and straightforward, this method may also reveal the nature of the manipulation to participants, by forcing them to consider reach direction on every trial. This may evoke explicit adaptation where normally there wouldn’t be any. To test this we had three groups of participants adapt to a 30° rotation. These were an instructed group (N=24) who were explained the manipulation and given a strategy to counter it, an aiming group (N=24) who pointed an arrow at where they said they would aim their reach on the next trial (without landmarks or reminder instructions) and a control group (N=24) who neither received instructions nor did aiming. Except for an initial benefit of instructions, each group adapted similarly. In all three groups we measured explicit and implicit contributions at the end of adaptation by asking people to either include (explicit+implicit) or exclude (implicit only) whatever strategy they thought they had. As expected, there was no difference between these two measures in the control group indicating fully implicit adaptation. The two measures differed in the instructed group, indicating partially explicit adaptation. The distribution of differences was uni-modal in these two groups, but in the aiming group, the distribution was bi-modal, with one peak around zero, akin to the control group, and one peak lined up with the peak of the instructed group. This shows that in about one third of participants aiming has the same effect as an instruction, so that aiming not only measures, but also causes explicit adaptation.",Marius 't Hart,"Urooj Taqvi, York University; Raphael Q.

However, the potential contribution of dendritic computations to network responses has remained relatively unexplored. Biophysically detailed neuron models are computationally expensive, thus not recommended for large-network simulations. Conversely, simplified yet realistic models require expertise and often a significant amount of effort to build. To address these issues, we developed Dendrify, a free, open-source Python package that facilitates the creation of spiking network models with compartmental neurons in Brian 2. Dendrify, through simple and intuitive commands, automatically generates all the equations and parameters needed to describe reduced neuron models, including a broad range of synaptic and dendritic mechanisms. Such models provide an efficient alternative for studying dendritic phenomena at the network level while achieving a reasonable balance between simulation performance and biological validity. Here we illustrate how Dendrify helps to effortlessly build simple neuron or network models, accurately reproducing a wide variety of experimental observations.

recGGOQIJAK7hLu97,Functional Representation of Vocal Musculature in the Motor Cortex of Mice,"Vocalizations are a dynamic and complex behavior that can be innate or learned. Vocal learners, animals that learn to imitate or modify vocalizations, use top-down input from the forebrain to provide fine motor control over vocal musculature. These forebrain circuits coordinate sub-cortical networks during, and after, learning to precisely execute these learned behaviors. Currently, we do not have genetically tractable mammalian models for speech and vocal learning.  However, behavioral and anatomical findings from our lab and others’ have shown that the ultrasonic song system of mice exhibits rudimentary features consistent with advanced features of vocal learners, including multisyllabic structure that varies with social context, and a small pool of cortical neurons in posteromedial M1 that projects directly to vocal motor neurons in the brainstem. To test if these M1 neurons can functionally activate vocal muscles, and possibly provide fine motor coordination, we used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) paired with electromyography (EMG) from vocal muscles in the larynx of anesthetized mice. We use latency from stimulation to EMG response to estimate the number of synapses between the cortex and the muscles, with shorter latencies meaning there are fewer neurons in the circuit (i.e. more direct connectivity). Using this approach, we found a representation of laryngeal musculature in posteromedial M1, consistent with our anatomical tracing, but also a second representation in anterolateral M1. The two regions have distinct latency and stimulation thresholds from one another. The anterolateral region, corresponding to orofacial motor cortex (OFC), has shorter latencies-to-response from stimulation and lower current injection thresholds. Conversely, the posteromedial region has longer latencies and higher thresholds. These two representations possibly underlie different functions of the laryngeal musculature in different behaviors, such as voluntary swallowing, breathing, or vocalizing. These results are the first characterization of the functional representations of laryngeal musculature in the rodent motor cortex.",César Vargas (he/him),"Elena Waidmann, The Rockefeller University; Erich D.

The behavioral strategies used to implement multi-step routes to goals in naturalistic settings are unknown. Here we show that mice spontaneously learn a subgoal memory strategy while escaping to shelter or seeking food in an obstructed environment. We first investigated how mice navigate to shelter in response to threats when the direct path is blocked by a wall. Initially, mice ran straight toward the shelter and circumvented the obstacle using sensory cues. Over the course of 20 minutes, however, they switched to a spatial memory strategy to execute spatially efficient paths. Efficient escape routes were not learned by reinforcing egocentric actions or by constructing an unbiased internal map during exploration. Instead, mice used a hybrid strategy: they memorized specific subgoal locations encountered during previous running movements toward the obstacle. We then found that the same behavioral strategy is also used in a reward-seeking task. These results show that spontaneous memorization of local subgoals is a fundamental strategy by which rodents execute efficient multi-step routes to goals in novel environments.",Philip Shamash,"Phillip Shamash, UCL; Sarah Olesen, UCL; Panagiota Iordanidou, UCL; Dario Campagner, UCL; Banerjee Nabhojit, UCL; Tiago Branco, UCL",University College London (grid.83440.3b),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Interactive talk,2020-10-29 12:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 12:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/QzXNDEfoF4I
recGJoHSeTO4DblTc,Development of Hearing in Neonatal Rats:  Cortical Responses to Air- and Bone-Conducted Sound.,"In rats, sensitivity to environmental sounds emerges at around P11-13. However, morphological studies suggest that for a few days before that, the hearing function is constrained mainly by the immaturity of structures responsible for sound conduction. In accordance with that, it was shown that the bone-conducted (BC) sounds, which bypass the immature outer and middle ear, can evoke auditory brainstem responses already from P7. Whether these early responses reach the auditory cortex, and what are their spatio-temporal features remain largely unknown. Using epidural uECoG arrays and intracortical silicone probes, we showed that, starting from P8, responses evoked by the BC-sound involve thalamus-mediated activation of the auditory cortex. The evoked potentials had the initial positive and the following negative peaks, the latencies and amplitudes of which significantly changed with age. These responses largely overlapped with the responses evoked by electrical stimulation of the cochlea and the inferior colliculus as well as with the responses to normal intensity air-conducted sound (70 dB) after the onset of hearing (>P13). Topographic mapping revealed that BC-evoked responses co-localize with high-frequency sound representations in the auditory cortex. In addition, we showed that BC-evoked responses can be eliminated by bilateral cochlear ablation. We also found that similar cortical responses to the airborne stimuli of high intensity (>100 dB) can be evoked starting from P8, suggesting that the onset of sensory function highly depends on the sound conduction. Our main finding is that the earliest responses evoked by BC and high-intensity airborne stimuli reach the auditory cortex and undergo significant improvement over the second postnatal week. We suggest that this stimulus-evoked activity can potentially cooperate with spontaneous activity in the formation of auditory circuits during the pre-hearing period. Besides that, our study reveals remarkable similarities in the major developmental milestones of the auditory and visual systems.

recGatrXH5ZTAhrKB,Attentional Sampling Strategies in Multi-Attribute Decision Making,"Many everyday decisions require us to consider multiple options, each comprised of a number of shared or different attributes. In such situations, optimal decisions require the simultaneous integration and comparison of a large amount of information. This complexity is thought to tax limited cognitive resources, requiring the use of attention to select a limited subset of information, upon which the decision is then based. To better understand the role of attention in decision making, subjects participated in multi-attribute decision making tasks in which we systematically varied the complexity of choices by increasing the number of options, or attributes, or both. Our task design uses eye position as an overt measure of attention while subjects choose between gambles that systematically cover the decision space. Each attribute's magnitude is masked by an opaque disk whose color indicates the attribute type. The attribute value is only revealed when the disk is actively fixated upon. Subjects freely inspect the attributes with no time constraint, before indicating their choice with a keypress. The resulting eye movements provide detailed temporal and spatial information about subjects' focus of attention during the attribute sampling process. 

We find that human participants mainly deploy two strategies for sampling decision-related information. When only few options are available, participants most frequently use an exhaustive strategy to sample all attributes of each option independently, before examining the next one (2-Option, 2-Attribute: 68% of subjects, 2-Option, 4-Attribute: 66%). This is an effective strategy because all information is examined. However, when more options are available, participants most commonly employ a filtering strategy. They first compare their most important attribute (which differs between subjects) across all options to identify the one or two best ones, and then sample all attributes of those best options (4-Option, 2-Attribute: 75% of subjects, 4-Option, 4-Attribute: 68%). This strategy reduces the amount of information that needs to be processed but can lead to suboptimal choices. Importantly, which strategy is used depends on the number of options, but not the number of attributes. Thus, increasingly complex decision problems evoke strategic shifts in the direction of attention during the search for the preferred option. Because our new task design provides detailed information over the temporal order of sampling the attributes, it retains the ability to control task requirements typical for laboratory designs, while still capturing important aspects of real-world decision making in complex environments. Thus, this task allows us to explore the neuronal mechanisms underlying the different strategies.",Jacob Elsey,"Jacob Elsey, Johns Hopkins University; Ernst Niebur, Johns Hopkins University; Veit Stuphorn, Johns Hopkins University",Johns Hopkins University (grid.21107.35),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-26 18:15:00+00:00,2020-10-26 18:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/yTn8nIKa2ME
recGebbloPfqSc2U1,Mutliple bouts of high intensity exercise and its effect on resting state functional connectivity and implicit motor learning in healthy older adults,"Older adults show both age-related decreases in resting state functional connectivity and sensorimotor function. Aerobic exercise has emerged as a potential intervention that may mitigate or even reverse these age-related declines. However, studies that have touted the impact of exercise on resting state functional connectivity or motor learning have done so focusing on one of these two dependent measures alone. Here we sought to understand whether exercise influences both resting state functional connectivity, and motor acquisition and learning in the same population of older adults. Forty-two healthy older adults rested or completed high intensity aerobic exercise for 23 minutes, then immediately practiced a complex, implicit motor task with their non-dominant hand across five separate sessions. Participants were also scanned before the first and after the fifth day of practice, and returned 24-hours and 35-days following their fifth day of practice to complete short- and long-term retention tests of behavioural change. Independent component analysis revealed increased connectivity in the frontoparietal network, the dorsal attentional network, and the cerebellar network in the exercise group. Seed-based analysis revealed strengthened connectivity between the limbic system and right cerebellum, between right lobule 9 and the right middle temporal gyrus, and between right lobule 10 and bilateral middle temporal gyri. There were no group implicit motor learning differences during acquisition or at either retention test. Overall, these data suggest that either exercise alone, or exercise paired with a novel implicit motor learning task augment resting state functional connectivity but do not enhance behavioural change beyond that stimulated by skilled motor practice in older healthy adults.

recGex7u8tW4qptWy,Advantageous inequity awareness in young children: the role of late positive potential (LPP) and emotional reactivity.,"“Inequity aversion” (IA) is the natural tendency to avoid unfair outcomes. IA can take two forms: disadvantageous inequity (DI) aversion (i.e. when one avoids receiving less than a peer), or advantageous inequity (AI) aversion (i.e. when someone denies receiving more than a peer). Usually DI aversion is prevalent since early ages, while AI aversion has an appearance in later developmental stages. Despite existing evidence about this topic from behavioural developmental studies, there is an increasing need to add a neurobiological perspective to bridge the gap between IA and its underlying neural processes. To better understand the relationship between this behaviour and emotional reactivity, we employed a Montecarlo approach with cluster-based permutation testing to analyze electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of seventeen 3- to 6-years-old children while they participated in a child-friendly Dictator Game (DG) task that included three types of offers: advantageous unequal (AI), disadvantageous unequal (DI) and fair (FA). After each offer, we asked children about their feelings. We observed that participants felt more sad with DI offers when compared to AI and FA offers. We also found higher late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes for AI offers when comparing to FA offers. These high LPP amplitudes after offer onset were related to the positive emotional responses to the offers. Therefore, we interpret that EEG amplitudes within LPP boundaries in pre-schoolers are an indicative of high emotional sensitivity to advantageous offers, which may explain the low levels of AI aversion in young children.",Nastassja Lopes Fischer (she/her),"Nastassja L.

How thirst circuits in the brain coordinate the appropriate goal-directed behavior, and how it can do so in the presence of opposing behavioral states such as hunger, is not well understood. We show that a persistent state of thirst is evoked by the precise activation and inactivation of overlapping central brain neuronal circuit elements in Drosophila. In a neuronal activation screen, we identified a subset of glutamatergic neurons that evoke robust thirst-related behaviors, including water seeking and intake; we named these neurons Durstig, the German for thirsty.These central brain neurons function downstream of sensory input and internal osmotic sensors to drive seeking to either open orin accessible water.Importantly, activation of Durstig neurons overrides food seeking in water replete but hungry flies. Thus, neural circuit elements that regulate hunger and thirst are tightly integrated.

Besides, astrocytes are organized in networks, building a neuron-glia network. We propose three mathematical representations of a neuron-glia network: upsilon-family, upsilon-multiset, and upsilon-multidigraph. We represent synapses as graphs of a relation on a set of general neurons and define an upsilon-family as an indexed family of them. Then, we generate a multiset from upsilon-family to simplify it. Analogously to multidigraphs, we define isomorphism for upsilon-multisets. As a final simplification, we unnest the upsilon-multiset, getting the upsilon-multidigraph. Although upsilon-multidigraph has not multiple connections, we conjecture that it preserves isomorphism. From edges vertex of an upsilon-multidigraph, we generate a multi-topology of proper submultisets. Additionally, we create a network descriptor from a quasimetric defined over the vertex set of an upsilon-multidigraph. Finally, we roughly create a geometric realization of an upsilon-family in a three-dimensional Euclidean space. We concluded that neuron-glial network representations have a rich mathematical structure.

Normally when a person perceives a target, ciliary and extraocular muscles are managed by the oculomotor nerve to clear the blur. The blur and disparity are corrected by altering the accommodation and vergence, respectively. 
CI is characterized by an inability to maintain binocularity while working at distances closer to the body, experienced usually as intermittent double-vision when focusing at a target. People with CI often complain of the inability to concentrate while doing near work and complain of headaches, double- vision, and strain - caused due to the fatigue of the extraocular and ciliary muscles. The neural feedback system of accommodation and vergence are co-dependent, in that they are connected via a closed-loop pathway. Physiologically, this is evident in the form of an ”Accommodation Triad” which consists of Accommodation, Convergence, and Pupil constriction. The accommodation triad describes an exceptional adaptation acquired as neural feedback in some subjects (despite fatigue) as an excess of accommodation to compensate for CI. I will present the neural mechanism and the theoretical computational model of this adaptive process.

These models are implemented within a Bayesian inference framework. Theory based and structural assumptions are used to develop evidence accumulation models whose parameters are hierarchically governed by cognitive subsystems, such as performance monitoring, belief updating, error-feedback, and executive control. Such models explicitly account for the temporal dynamics and learning associated with repeated decision making. They dissociate between different potential cognitive processes and strategies that may be used on a trial-by-trial basis, and account for the hierarchical process of strategy switching. The hierarchical cognitive processes and subsystems are characterized by cognitive parameters that potentially capture and mediate the relationship between neural (fMRI) and behavioral data. Such neuro-cognitive modeling allows us to differentiate between theories, provide insights into the developmental maturation of brain networks, and improve the identification of differential brain feature characteristics associated with different cognitive processes in clinical and neuro-diverse populations.

recH1bpFzQRSeugwD,Is attention modulating alpha oscillatory activity focally for task-related locations or globally also to task-irrelevant locations?,"Research on endogenous attention suggests that spatial and temporal expectations influence the processing of visual stimuli in part by hijacking ongoing alpha-band oscillatory activity in brain areas involved in visual perception. However, it is not known if this top-down modulation of alpha is selective for the circuits that represent the focus of spatial attention, or if it is also deployed for the active control of processing at non-target locations. To answer this question, we manipulated spatial and temporal predictability during a Posner-style visual discrimination task, in which, within a block, stimuli could only appear in two of the four cardinal locations (i.e., only left-right target locations during some blocks, only top-bottom targets during others). This allowed us to distinguish “ignored” locations (i.e., not cued on a particular trial) from “irrelevant” ones (never cued during a particular block). We used inverted encoding modelling to generate topographic filters to isolate the alpha oscillatory activity associated with each of the four target locations. Behavioral results showed an influence of spatial expectations on both discrimination performance and eye-movement patterns, with hints of a weaker influence of temporal expectations. In addition to the standard pattern of “alpha desynchronization” at the locus of attention, the EEG results revealed no difference in the effects of spatial or temporal expectations on the alpha-band dynamics associated with ignored versus irrelevant locations. These results do not find evidence that alpha-band dynamics are differently controlled for ignored versus irrelevant locations, but instead suggest that they reflect a more global phenomenon that covers all representations of visual space outside the focus of attention.",Mattia Pietrelli (he/him/his),"Pietrelli, M., University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison; Samaha, J., University of California, Santa Cruz; Postle, BR., University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison",University of Wisconsin–Madison (grid.14003.36),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 17:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 17:30:00+00:00,

Our findings show that the coarse model provides a good fit and captures the qualitative behavior of the complex fine model.

As a result, officers are routinely exposed to uncertain, unpredictable, and potentially violent encounters.

An understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these errors in perception, judgement, and behaviour is lacking in the response to countless examples of excessive use of force by police. Through our investigations of these mechanisms, we have contributed to a growing body of research that supports evidence-based use of force training and practices. In this interactive talk, we will begin by synthesizing the current state-of-the-art on neurophysiological investigations of perception, cognition, and behaviour among police populations. Relevant research topics include: situational awareness (i.e., sensory perception, attention, threat assessment, prediction); memory (i.e., encoding, consolidation, retrieval); decision-making (e.g., shoot/no-shoot); and skilled motor performance. We will also briefly discuss practical challenges to conducting empirical research in applied police settings, and the fine balance between maintaining experimental control and ecological validity.  We invite feedback from attendees in a wide range of disciplines to stimulate an active yet focused discussion. Through this discourse, we hope to identify important gaps in knowledge, future areas of inquiry, and innovative methodological approaches.

recHFvIpuZWubAgmN,Exploring the relationship between functional ultrasound and neuronal activity ,"Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi) is an appealing method for measuring blood-volume signals from the brain. However, the blood-volume signal measured by fUSi bears an unclear relationship to the underlying neuronal firing. Is this relationship linear, and stable across brain regions, subjects, and time?

To answer these questions, we performed simultaneous fUSi measurements and Neuropixels recordings in awake mice. Eight recording sessions were performed across four mice (~4 coronal slices per session). We inserted one or two Neuropixels probes per session, and related firing recorded from these probes to fUSi signals from the corresponding regions of interest (ROIs).

A linear model provided a good estimate of fUSi signals based on neuronal firing. We measured the multi-unit activity (MUA) from the Neuropixel probes and convolved it with a hemodynamic filter (4.2 s causal window). The filter was estimated using a linear regression model using half the data from one recording, and tested on the second half. Model predictions were accurate (r > 0.5). Furthermore, this model generalized across mice: it increased prediction accuracy relative to an instantaneous MUA model with no delay in all sessions in all three held-out mice. The hemodynamic filter resembled one measured optically, peaking ~1.5 s after neural activity (Pisauro, et al., J Neurosci 2013).

These results indicate that the relationship between neuronal firing and fUSi is stable and linear. Our current efforts aim to optimize the processing of fUSi signals so that they best capture variations in neuronal firing across both time and space.

recHTyr5TFUxGELmY,Spatial connectivity matches direction selectivity in visual cortex,"The selectivity of neuronal responses arises from the architecture of excitatory and inhibitory connections. In primary visual cortex, the selectivity of layer 2/3 neurons for stimulus orientation and direction is thought to arise from similarly-selective intracortical inputs. A neuron’s excitatory inputs, however, can have diverse stimulus preferences, and inhibitory inputs can be promiscuous and unselective. We revealed that excitatory and inhibitory intracortical connections to a layer 2/3 neuron accord with its selectivity by obeying precise spatial patterns. We used rabies tracing to label and functionally image the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to individual pyramidal neurons of mouse visual cortical layer 2/3. Presynaptic excitatory neurons spanned layers 2/3 and 4 and were distributed coaxial to the postsynaptic neuron’s preferred orientation, favouring the region opposite to its preferred direction. By contrast, presynaptic inhibitory neurons resided within layer 2/3 and favoured locations near the postsynaptic neuron and ahead of its preferred direction. The direction selectivity of a postsynaptic neuron was unrelated to the selectivity of presynaptic neurons but correlated with the spatial displacement between excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic ensembles. Similar asymmetric connectivity establishes direction selectivity in the retina, suggesting that this circuit motif might be canonical in sensory processing.
We are currently discovering similar patterns in the morphological reconstructions of the postsynaptic neurons, whose dendritic trees extended preferentially along the neurons’ preferred orientation. These results suggest a link between the dendritic architecture and the function of V1 neurons: by extending towards the appropriate inputs, dendrites may provide a morphological substrate for the emergence of visual selectivity.

recHWPjk9lyQwsk7N,A Novel Quantitative Method Assessing EEG Reactivity in Comatose Patients on ECMO,"Objective:
Electroencephalogram (EEG) reactivity, defined as a change in EEG frequency or amplitude due to external stimulation, is used to assess responsiveness in comatose patients. We present a quantitative method to analyze EEG data from patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. 

Methods:
EEG was acquired from 22 ECMO patients using a standardized stimulation paradigm that included auditory, noxious touch, and nostril stimulation. Data were divided into 111 total epochs and assessed using two metrics: spectral power and permutation entropy. We classified epochs based on increase or decrease of each metric in response to stimulation and computed scores for each epoch, both overall and for each spectral sub-band. Scores were grouped and validated against visual analysis of raw EEG. 

Results:
Variations were found to occur in all cerebral regions for both metrics. The mean overall scores for all types of stimulation for those patients identified by visual analysis as reactive were significantly higher than for those identified as unreactive: auditory (50.03 ± 46.11 vs 25.14 ± 12.27, p < 0.05), noxious touch (50.93 ±  33.32 vs 22.48 ± 11.45, p < 0.001), and nostril (48.64 ±  13.56 vs 19.61 ± 13.80, p < 0.01). Although nostril stimulation induced the largest difference on our metrics, it also resulted in the most epochs disqualified due to artifacts. 

Conclusion:
Our findings provide preliminary support for the validity of a quantitative (rather than qualitative) EEG scoring system assessing the response to stimulation using our qEEG metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply qEEG methods in the assessment of EEG reactivity in patients on ECMO support. We anticipate that further validation of this quantitative method on larger patient populations will enable new avenues of investigation and test its prognostic value.",Yinuo Zeng,"Autumn Williams, Johns Hopkins University Department of Biomedical Engineering; Romergryko G.

However, despite its long history, it is unclear whether alpha power alone or alpha’s modulation of other frequency bands best accounts for attentional and perceptual task performance. To address this question, we plan to use quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifier to test whether covert attentional states can be decoded from alpha power alone or from alpha modulated gamma activity prior to target onset. 
The data to be analyzed was collected from 34 participants performing a cued orientation detection task while EEG was recorded simultaneously. The task consisted of an informative cue (indicating right or left side) or uninformative cue (pointing towards both the left and right), then a target on the left or right pointing in one direction followed by a backward mask, a short delay, and then a response screen where participants used the mouse to rotate the pointing stimuli so that it matches the orientation of the target. Participants were instructed to use covert attention only. Errors on each trial were quantified as the difference between the target orientation and the orientation of participants’ response.

This phenomenon reflects the interhemispheric balance in the motor system. We hypothesize that pMA may serve as a model for studying the somatotopy of the interhemispheric interactions. We assume that pMA would be more prominent in the homologue muscles of the opposite hand compared to non-homologue muscles.
We obtained the  preliminary results from 11 healthy right handed participants (7 females, 19 to 28 y.o.). Surface EMG was recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis, first dorsal interosseous, abductor digiti minimi from both hands. Extensor carpi ulnaris and flexor carpi ulnaris were used as control muscles. Subjects performed three motor tasks (thumb abduction, index finger extension, little finger abduction) in a pseudo-random order with their right hand while pMA was measured in the left.

We observed pMA in the left hand muscles in 9 out of 12 participants with presence of < 50% of the trials. pMA tended to increase with the repetitions in the experiment course. Average pick-to-pick amplitude of pMA was 150 μV, while pMA latency varied between 50ms to 4500 ms. With regard to the pMA somatotopy, the phenomenon was more prominent in homologues muscles than in non-homologues ones.

While this may yield insights into the role of internal models and optimal feedback control strategies, it is challenging to extrapolate this understanding to more advanced tasks such as interacting with objects that have internal dynamics. Using the extreme example of manipulating a bullwhip, this study asked how humans can achieve dexterity in manipulating the wave dynamics of the whip's infinite number of degrees of freedom. 
16 participants attempted to hit a target with the 1.60m-long whip either in discrete style, with pauses between throws of the whip, or in rhythmic style, where the whip never came to rest between throws. Performance was quantified by success rate, error and variability of error. All measures showed better performance in the discrete style, but performance showed improvement only in the rhythmic style. Hand trajectories in state space and speed profiles indicated similar patterns for both styles. In particular, the tangential speed of the hand revealed two principal submovements in both styles, identifying two movement phases: preparatory phase and throwing phase. The preparatory phase was significantly longer and peak speed significantly higher in the discrete style. Comparison of the whip motion showed smoother unfolding in the rhythmic style, indicating smoother energy propagation along the whip.
Taken together these findings indicate that having more time in the discrete style to set proper initial conditions allows for a better performance. However, the features found in the rhythmic style suggest other mechanisms might be engaged. Based on observations of a two-peaked hand speed profile, we suggest that humans may represent control of this prodigiously complex dynamic object in terms of the parameters of primitive actions –  submovements – that are used for interactive control.",Marta Russo,"Aleksei Krotov, Northeastern University; Hillary Hoyt, Northeastern University; Mahdiar Edraki, Northeastern University; Reza Razavian, Northeastern University; Moses Nah, MIT; Neville Hogan, MIT; Dagmar Sternad, Northeastern University",Northeastern University (grid.261112.7),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 20:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 20:15:00+00:00,
recHg3jryKIqIByfd,Sensory stimulation for improved phantom limb perception and control,"A major challenge for controlling a prosthetic arm is communication between the device and the user’s phantom limb. The lack of sensory information to the phantom hand weakens the internal sensorimotor model that drives movement. We showed that targeted transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tTENS) can be used to provide sensory stimulation and improve phantom limb perception and control. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation experiments were performed with four participants with arm amputation to map and understand their phantom limb perception. Results show that sensory stimulation improves the participants’ ability to perceive and move the phantom hand, which leads to improved movement decoding and functional prosthesis control. In an extended study with one participant, we found that sensory mapping remained stable over 2 years. Sensory stimulation improved within-day movement decoding while overall performance over 1 year remained stable. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with two participants, we observed cortical correlates of sensorimotor integration and increased motor-related neural activity as a result of enhanced phantom limb perception.

recHgTruZqzsCXrdU,Right fronto-parietal network is associated with phasic alertness in healthy aging,"Phasic alerting cues temporarily increase the brain’s arousal state. In younger and older participants, such phasic alerting cues increase the speed of processing visual information on the perceptual level. We investigated whether intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) in the cingulo-opercular and/ or right fronto-parietal network underlie phasic alerting effects in healthy older participants. We acquired resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data and performed an independent component analysis and dual regression in 31 healthy older adults. A voxel-wise multiple regression yielded that higher phasic alerting effects on visual processing speed were significantly related to lower right fronto-parietal network iFC. This result suggests a particular role of the right fronto-parietal network for phasic alertness in healthy aging. ",Marleen Haupt,Adriana L.

recHq595yhtFoGLfv,The organization and developmental establishment of cortical interneuron presynaptic circuits,"Sensory and cognitive functions are processed in discrete cortical areas and depend upon the integration of long range cortical and subcortical inputs. PV and SST inhibitory interneurons (cINs) gate these inputs and failure to do so properly is implicated in many neurodevelopmental disorders. The logic by which these interneuron populations are integrated into cortical circuits and how these vary across sensory versus associative cortical areas is unknown. To answer this question, we began by surveying the breadth of afferents impinging upon PV and SST cINs within distinct cortical areas.  In contrast to the characterized thalamic and cortical canonical circuits, we found that the afferents to PV and SST cINs receive similar projections within areal location. However, the identity of the thalamic and cortical neuron is variable according to the cell-types they project to. During development, cell-type specific circuits are specialized via areal-specific progression, regression and transitory connectivity. Remarkably the organization of thalamocortical afferents to SST and PV cINs reach their mature specificity through distinct mechanisms. While thalamocortical afferents to PV IN are regulated by sensory experience, projections to SST IN developed through postsynaptic mGluR1 receptor activation. Altogether, these data provide a comprehensive map of cIN afferents within different functional cortical areas and reveal the region-specific logic by which PV and SST cIN circuits are established.",Gabrielle Pouchelon,"Gabrielle Pouchelon, Harvard Medical School, Department of Neurobiology, Broad Institute, Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research; Yannick Bollmann, Aix Marseille University, INSERM, INMED, Turing Center for Living Systems; Elaine Fisher, Harvard Medical School, Department of Neurobiology, Broad Institute, Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research; Chimuanya K Agba, Harvard Medical School, Department of Neurobiology, Broad Institute, Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research; Qing Xu, Center for Genomics & Systems Biology, New York University; Kimberly D Ritola, Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Andrea Mirow, Harvard Medical School, Department of Neurobiology, Broad Institute, Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research; Seyhun Kim, Harvard Medical School, Department of Neurobiology, Broad Institute, Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research; Rosa Cossart, Aix Marseille University, INSERM, INMED, Turing Center for Living Systems; Gord Fishell, Harvard Medical School, Department of Neurobiology, Broad Institute, Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research.",Harvard Medical School (grid.471403.5),"Theme A: Development, Neurodegenerative Disorders and Injury",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 17:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 17:30:00+00:00,
recHuYB5vrph0hXQU,Modelling Appetitive-Disinhibition in Modified Stop-Signal Task—A Computational model of Associative Memory initiated Going (Disinhibition) System,"Background: Studies employing modified Stop-signal tasks (MSST) have demonstrated that response-inhibition, a key executive-function, severely impairs in appetitive environments. These studies demonstrate that presence of appetitive-cues results in disinhibited response and slow-stopping latencies (i.e., Stop-Signal Reaction-Times or SSRT’s). Theoretical-frameworks propose that retrieval of appetitive-cue–approach/going-response associations (developed during appetitive-conditioning) from ones associative-memory traces, biases the inhibitory-system such that it produces approach/going (i.e., disinhibited-response) post exposure to appetitive-cues. 
Aims: The aim of the current study was to develop a computational model of response-disinhibition i.e., a going-system. In developing this model, we introduced a new free-parameter ‘λ’ which instantiated associative-memory recall. We augmented λ to the Interactive Race Model (IRM) of action suppression to model the interaction between the associative-memory (i.e., λ) and inhibitory-system (i.e., IRM) with an aim to simulate disinhibited-responses (indicated by slow SSRT’s) observed in MSST studies. 
Methods: We tested three model types which differed in how λ affected go-process and stop-process in IRM formalism. In the first model (Associative-Memory Interactive Disinhibition-Model–AMI) the λ parameters affected the mutual inhibitory-interaction between go-process and stop-process. In the second model (Associative-Memory Race Disinhibition-Model–AMR) λ parameters affected the mean growth-rate of go-process and stop-process. In the final model (Associative- Memory Interactive Race Disinhibition-Model–AMIR) λ parameters affected both mean growth-rate and mutual inhibitory-interaction between go-process and stop-process simultaneously. 
Results: The modelling results indicated that out of the three models, only the first model–AMI, produced slow SSRT’s observed in appetitive-cue conditions in MSST studies. 
Conclusion: The current study validated the theoretical propositions that associative-memory and inhibitory-system interact with each other in producing appetitive-cue initiated disinhibition. It specifically highlighted that associative-memory affects the mutual inhibitory-interaction (between go-process and stop-process) aspect of the inhibitory-system in giving rise to appetitive-cue initiated disinhibited-responses observed in MSST studies.

recHvHWFivfkbRGMp,Synaptic evidence for the cumulative effects of tDCS in spaced learning  ,"Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is thought to improve learning by modulating Hebbian synaptic plasticity. The majority of in vitro studies supporting this theory use electric fields that are much higher than those generated with transcranial stimulation in humans (20V/m vs 1 V/m). The effectiveness of tDCS has also been called into question because of the relatively small effect sizes. There is therefore a need to improve the effectiveness of tDCS at realistic field intensities. Here we leverage the observation that effects of learning in humans are known to accumulate over multiple bouts of learning, known as spaced learning. This cumulative effect has been replicated in synaptic long term potentiation (LTP) experiments in vitro.    Hypothesis: We propose that effects of DCS on synaptic LTP can accumulate over time in a spaced learning paradigm.    Methods: We studied the cumulative effects of DCS at various intensities applied during the induction of LTP in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices using theta burst stimulation (TBS).  Results: DCS applied during repeated bouts of TBS resulted in an increase of LTP.  Spaced learning saturated quickly with strong TBS protocols, thus obscuring cumulative effects of DCS. However, with weaker TBS, we saw a cumulative effect of spaced learning, including a cumulative boost of LTP with electric fields of lower intensity.    Conclusions: These results support the notion that the effects of tDCS accumulate through an increasing synaptic strength after repeated bouts of learning.

recHzfyBvLRW4cYuk,A meta-learning approach to (re)discover plasticity rules that carve a desired function to a neural network,"The search for biologically faithful synaptic plasticity rules has resulted in a large body of models. They are usually inspired by -- and fitted to -- experimental data, but they rarely produce neural dynamics that serve complex functions. These failures suggest that current plasticity models are still under-constrained by existing data. 

Therefore, we showcase an alternative approach that uses meta-learning to discover useful synaptic plasticity rules. Instead of experimental data, the rules are constrained by the functions they implement and the structure they are meant to produce. Briefly, we parameterize synaptic plasticity rules by a Volterra expansion and then use supervised learning methods (like gradient descent or evolutionary strategies) to minimize a problem-dependent loss function that quantifies how effectively a candidate plasticity rule transforms an initially random network into one with the desired function. 

We first validate our approach by re-discovering previously described plasticity rules. We start at the single-neuron level with “Oja’s rule”', a simple Hebbian plasticity rule that captures the direction of most variability of inputs to a neuron (i.e., the first principal component). We expand the problem to the network level and ask the framework to find Oja’s rule together with an anti-Hebbian rule such that an initially random two-layer firing-rate network will recover several principal components of the input space after learning. Finally, we study networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with plastic inhibitory afferents. We train for rules that achieve a target firing rate by countering tuned excitation. We find that our algorithm selects a specific subset of the manifold of rules that can solve this task.

Come to our presentation to find out if you want to use our framework or discuss what predictions you would like it to make.

recI5D0QaJ857Y4JI,Autopilot: a distributed vision for the extravagant complexity of naturalistic neuroscience experiments,"To understand the brain, it is increasingly clear that neuroscientists need to study it in its natural context of complex, contingent, and open-ended behavior. Naturalistic experiments invite neuroscientists to imagine beyond the constraints of their traditional rigs, but dreams of observing neural activity in multiple unrestrained animals in complex, hardware-dense environments are rudely grounded by technical complexity. Neuroscientists are intrepid, used to cobbling together the many mutually unintelligible components their experimental apparatuses require, but idiosyncratic builds are costly to re-develop and place hard limits on experimental replication. Autopilot is a Python framework for behavioral neuroscience that tackles problems of technical scale by distributing experiments over swarms of networked computers, principally Raspberry Pis. Rather than relying on an ecosystem of system-specific components, Autopilot provides the infrastructure to integrate your existing hardware or to use the many inexpensive peripherals available to the Raspberry Pi. Its distributed design allows effectively arbitrary numbers of hardware components to be coordinated in an experiment -- just add more computers. We attempted to blur the line between using and developing Autopilot: rather than writing scripts that ""sit on top of"" a fixed library, users are encouraged to be playful with its core components and write their experiments ""within"" it. Our vision is to nudge heroic reinventions of the wheel towards a shared, communally developed library of hardware controllers and experimental prototypes. Autopilot balances flexibility with reproducibility by separating an experiment's design from the particularities of its implementation. Data produced by Autopilot are clean and exhaustive at the time of collection, allowing direct replication of an experiment from a single file. In sum we built Autopilot to give neuroscientists the freedom to design the hare-brainedly complex experiments needed to study the behaving brain in a framework that encourages communally-developed and reproducible science.

recI7hu96ToSLsx84,Potentiation and Sequestration of Lipid Profile and Oxidative Stress in CdCl2 Mediated Neurotoxicity; Two Sides of Palm Oil Fractions,"Objective: This study was to determine if pretreatment with palm oil fractions could mitigate against sub-chronic cadmium mediated oxidative stress and lipid profile in the brain.
Design: The experimental study comprised six groups A-F. Rats in group A served as the normal control and received normal feed and water only, group B negative control received CdCl2 only. Test groups (C-F) received 5ml/Kg body weight of appropriate palm oil fractions: Crude Palm oil (CPO), Silica Gel Extract (SGE), Bleached Palm Oil (BPE), and Unsaponifiable Extract (UPE) from day 1-21 respectively. This was followed by sub-chronic exposure to 5mg/kg bodyweight CdCl2 through gavage to rats in groups B-F from day 22-43. Six rats from each group were sacrificed and the brain tissues excised for oxidative stress indices and lipid profile on days 29 and 43 of the experiment.
Results: Findings indicates significant rise of brain lipid peroxidation in experimental groups relative to control. Comparatively, CPO, SGE, and BPE increased brain MDA levels and reduced SOD and catalase enzyme activities compared to those that received only CdCl¬2. Sulphite oxidase enzyme was significantly reduced in test groups relative to control. Our study also demonstrated a significant increase in brain GSH in animals that received UPE compared to control. Brain lipid profile showed a significant rise in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, a significant reduction in triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol in CdCl2, CPO, SGE, BPE groups. UPE mediated a reverse in the order of lipid profile observed in other palm oil fractions relative to control.
Conclusion: Palm oil fractions (CPO, SGE, and BPE) pre-administration potentiated brain oxidative stress indices, brain (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol) and reduced HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride in a sub-chronic CdCl2 toxicity. UPE, on the other hand, sequestered brain increase of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol while promoting activities of selected antioxidant defense markers in the brain.

recICJ8MxVVoOgK8s,Developmental dynamics of bottom-up and top-down input integration onto L1 interneurons in the sensory cortex,"Information processing in a sensory cortex combines ‘bottom-up’ sensory experience, with feedback from higher cortical areas, modulation by subcortical systems, as well as cross-modal modulation by other sensory cortices. These projections jointly create an internal representation used to predict the incoming stimuli and reconcile it with expectation. How such representations emerge during development are not well understood. L1 interneurons (INs) are positioned at the nexus where top-down and bottom-up information converges and thus are likely playing a critical role in this modulation. They receive both strong cortico-cortical inputs from higher cortices, as well as bottom-up thalamic inputs and their inhibitory nature allows them to modulate sensory processing. Retrograde rabies tracing during early postnatal development within primary auditory (A1) and primary visual (V1) cortex, demonstrated that L1 INs receive strong first-order thalamic inputs during early sensory signaling. While these persist into adulthood, they become diminished. We hypothesize that the dominant bottom up input is important for establishing and refining long range top-down inputs (such as from the Anterior Cingulate Cortex, ACA,  Premotor Cortex, M2 and Retrosplenial Cortex, RSP) onto L1 INs. Our in-vitro patch clamp data suggests that L1 interneurons in A1 and V1 receive functional inputs from the first-order thalamus; MGBv and dLGN respectively, and some of those inputs are mirrored in L4.  By simultaneously providing L1 interneurons with both ascending sensory inputs, as well as cortico-cortical feedback inputs, accurate sensory processing and modulation in L2/3 can be established. Through this process the projections from the ACA/M2 which are initially abundant but weak are refined and strengthened. As this occurs precisely during the period when thalamic inputs are decreased, we posit that these two events are functionally coordinated. Additionally, our preliminary data suggests that sensory experience is necessary for the strengthening and refinement of these cortical top down inputs. We thus predict that bottom-up inputs to L1 interneurons during development are important for the establishment of cortico-cortical feedback circuitry.

recIDCu9QfhvSD5bw,Flexible modulation of navigational processing in association cortices as a function of task context,"Animals engage in a variety of navigational behaviors that require different regimes of behavioral control and different temporal scales of predictive coding. In the wild, rats readily switch between foraging and more complex behaviors such as chase, wherein they pursue other rats or small prey (Calhoun, 1963). These behaviors require vastly different tracking of multiple behaviorally-significant variables including self-motion state. It is unknown whether changes in behavioral context flexibly modulate the encoding of these variables. To explore this possibility, we compared self-motion processing in multisensory association cortices while rats performed alternating blocks of free foraging and visual target pursuit. Rats learned the pursuit task and demonstrated predictive processing by anticipating target trajectories and intercepting them. Relative to free exploration, pursuit sessions yielded greater proportions of parietal and retrosplenial cortex neurons with reliable sensitivity to self-motion. Pursuit self-motion correlates possessed enhanced signal-to-noise ratios, as a consequence of multiplicative gain modulation, which led to greater decoding accuracy of self-motion state over extended temporal windows of behavior. Finally, many self-motion sensitive neurons conjunctively tracked the position of the visual target relative to the animal in egocentric coordinates providing a potential mechanism for the observed gain changes to self-motion signals. We conclude that association cortex ensembles multiplex navigation-relevant variables in a dynamic manner to enhance behaviorally-relevant  computations as a consequence of task demands.",Andrew Alexander,A.S.

recIFMWhUjv7TwVxA,Spatial and temporal cues of a stem cell direct the circuit partnership in Drosophila larval nerve cord,"One of the long-lasting questions in the neuroscience field of is how circuits assemble starting from the level of neuronal stem cells. It is well-established that a small pool of stem cells generates widely diverse neurons through programs of gene expression—including spatial and temporal patterning. In contrast, how the spatial and temporal cues affect circuit assembly is poorly understood. This information will improve stem-cell based therapeutics for repair of damaged CNS tissue. In this study, we examine stem cell derived spatial and temporal cues in neurons that synapses with each other by determining their stem cell origin and neuronal birth timing. We use the Drosophila larval motor system as a model, focusing specifically on the neurons derived from neuronal stem cell NB3-3 and their presynaptic neurons. We applied electron microscopic connectome annotation of synaptic partnerships and advanced molecular genetic lineage tracing. Specifically, we characterize input connectivity for each neuron of NB3-3, and then determine stem cell origin and neuronal birth timing of both NB3-3 neurons and nerve cord interneurons that synapse onto NB3-3 neurons. The impact of this study is three fold. 1) It provides tools that will enable researchers to infer developmental origin of neurons in the Drosophila larval nerve cord. 2) It establishes NB3-3 as a powerful model system to study circuit assembly. 3) It suggests that the integration of spatial and temporal patterning information provides guidance for interneuron synaptic partnerships. Ultimately, our study revealed that the programs of gene expression known to promote neuronal diversity also regulate circuit wiring.

If the neural signal of visual activities is regarded as a special kind of human biological language, it is quite feasible that we can apply the machine translation architecture in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to decode those neural signals. Therefore, a progressive transfer language decoding model was proposed to decode visual fMRI signals into phrases or sentences when natural images were being processed. The results of a similarity analysis showed that human natural language was successfully derived from visual neural activities. Additionally, by comparing the decoding effectivity of different visual areas in space, we found that higher visual areas usually had better performance. At the same time, we found that the contribution curve of visual response patterns in language decoding rose first and then gradually decreased at successively different time points. Our findings proved that the neural representations elicited in the visual cortex when visual scene tasks were being performed already contained semantic information that could be utilized to generate the human natural language.

Previous studies showed that task demand affects object representations in higher-level visual areas but not so much in earlier areas. There are, however, limitations in those studies concerning the relatively weak manipulation of task due to the use of familiar real-life objects, and/or the low temporal resolution in brain activation measures such as fMRI. In the current study, observers categorized images of artificial objects in one of two orthogonal dimensions, shape and texture. Electroencephalogram (EEG), a technique with higher temporal resolution, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) were employed to reveal object processing across time under different task demands. Results showed that object processing along the task-relevant dimension was enhanced starting from a relatively late time (~230ms after image onset), within the time range of the event-related potential (ERP) components N170 and N250. The findings are consistent with the view that task exerts an effect on object processing at the later phases of processing in the ventral visual pathway.

recIQBHhlr3JswXbb,Are age-related changes in internal model function linked to poorer somatosensory function?,"Motor functions are thought to be decreasing with age. Yet, in two different motor paradigms linked to internal model function, we observed that the performance of the older participants was ""better"" than that of younger participants. In a force matching task involving the arm, participants were asked to reproduce a force by applying a force with one arm onto the other arm. In this case, the reproduced force is higher in older participants than in younger participants. This overshoot in force is linked to the fact that an internal model predicts the movement of our own arm and hence the intensity of the sensation of the internally-generated force is decreased (Parthasharathy, Mantini and Orban de Xivry, 2020; Wolpe et al. 2016).

Similarly, in the task-irrelevant clamped feedback task (Morehead et al. 2017), participants are asked to bring their invisible hand to a target but the cursor trajectory is deviated on the left or right of the target by a constant angle. That is, the cursor direction is made fully independent from the hand direction while the velocity of hand and cursor are matched. When the perturbation is introduced, implicit motor adaptation occurs because of the introduced sensory prediction error (the difference between the expected and actual cursor direction). As a result, the hand direction drifts opposite to the cursor unbeknownst to the participant. This drift is larger in older participants (Vandevoorde and Orban de Xivry, 2019). 

In both cases, the increased response from older participants could be linked to their age-related deficits in somatosensory function. In the force-matching task, the overshoot in force is thought to be the result of the balance between sensory information and internal model output. Given the accepted age-related deficits in somatosensory function (e.g. proprioception), the large overshoot in older people might be due to their poorer somatosensory function. In the motor adaptation task, proprioception would ensure that the hand does not drift too far away from where the participants think the hand is going.

Yet, across several experiments with both tasks, we failed to find any link between somatosensory function and the performance in the force-matching task (Parthasharathy, Mantini and Orban de Xivry, 2020) or the motor adaptation tasks (Vandevoorde and Orban de Xivry, in preparation). This interactive presentation will be centered on the discussion of why elderly participans are ""better"" at these tasks.

recIQOmYdIKfpXEkO,Effects of memory for emotional valence and episodic detail on decision-making in aging,"Objective: Older adults often show an increased vulnerability to fraud and frequently have decline in episodic memory. We examined how memory for a single prior experience influences older adults’ decision-making.

Methods: We presented older (n = 41) and middle-aged (n = 31) adult participants with pictures of social partners in a “dictator game”, or of houses in an analogous non-social task. Participants could gain $5 (high-reward) or $0 (low-reward) from each face or house. Each image was shown once. Minutes later, participants were asked to choose whether to play again with each person or house. After choices, memory for each face/house and for associated reward was tested. Neuroimaging data were collected from a subset (n = 11) of older adults. In a behavioral follow-up study (n = 137), collected online and sampled across the lifespan, we examined whether choices are driven by memory for reward valence (i.e., high vs. low reward) or specific episodic details. Here, rewards were varied in 10-cent increments within each valence (low: $0-$1.50; high: $3.60-$5.00), and the memory test included the exact value (e.g., $3.80), a same-valence incorrect lure (e.g., $4.30), and 2 opposite-valence values (e.g., $1.00).

Results: While older adults showed poorer associative memory overall, accuracy of confident responses was comparable across age groups. Confident memory for face/house-reward ($0 or $5) associations was related to subsequent choices in both age groups, as participants were much more likely to play again with faces or houses that they correctly believed were high vs. low value, though the effect was somewhat weaker in older adults. A preliminary analysis of fMRI data suggests that making adaptive choices (playing with rewarding partners or avoiding non-rewarding partners) was associated with increased BOLD signal in amygdala and hippocampus/parahippocampal cortex, relative to maladaptive choices. In the behavioral follow-up study, choices were consistent with memory responses even when the same-valence but incorrect lure was chosen. Memory for exact values was still above chance, however, and adaptive choices were even more likely when exact memory was available. 

Conclusions: Older adults are capable of using explicit associative memory to guide decisions. However, across the lifespan, such decisions may rely largely on emotional valence memory (reliant on amygdala), which tends to be more preserved with age than episodic memory for details (e.g., Limbert et al., 2018). The latter appears to provide a further boost to decision-making, however, so age-related memory deficits could still lead to suboptimal choices.",Michael Cohen,"Michael S.

Saccades during free viewing generate large neural responses, which have been linked to enhanced visual processing during the subsequent fixations. The content of fixation prior to a saccade is known to modulate post-saccading processing during free viewing of static images. But this phenomenon has not yet been established for more realistic dynamic visual stimuli. To emulate a natural setting, subjects were asked to detect visual targets that appear on the road while being driven through a 3D virtual town. We predicted that target- and saccade-evoked potentials are modulated by the visibility of those targets and their location in the visual field. Virtual “fog” reduced the visibility of targets, and decreased target- and saccade-evoked potentials, as expected. Saccade-evoked responses were stronger when saccades are prompted by a target appearing on the road as compared to spontaneous saccades. When targets appeared in peripheral vision, they elicited larger eye movements with a concomitant increase in saccade-evoked response. However, contrary to our expectations, targets elicited similar evoked responses regardless of where they appeared in the visual field. In conclusion, visibility of stimuli appearing before saccades affect post-saccadic processing. However, differences in neural responses to events occurring in foveal vs peripheral vision, could not be disentangled from differences in saccade behavior.",Atanas Stankov,"Atanas D Stankov, City College of New York; Jonathan Touryan, Army Research Lab; Stephen Gordon, Army Research Lab; Jason Ki, City College of New York; Lucas Parra, City College of New York;",City College of New York (grid.254250.4),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-27 21:00:00+00:00,2020-10-27 21:15:00+00:00,
recIVDgCzRrXLwxHR,Seeing through the Mind’s Eye: Reconstruction of the visual stimuli using 3D Generative-Adversarial Modeling,"A long-standing challenge in systems neuroscience is to understand how the brain processes visual stimuli and its internal representation in the brain. This enhances our understanding of how sensory information is encoded in the brain which in-turn offers insights into how the brain is processing information.

Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a complex problem. Previous neuroimaging studies have been focused on decoding orientation, position, object category, and reconstruction of the 2D image stimuli presented to the subject, however, such approaches fail to decode the spatial, temporal, and other information already encoded in the neuroimaging data.

Unsupervised learning techniques show promise in learning these complex representations between the visual stimuli and neuroimaging data. 

Our self-supervised neural decoding pipeline initially converts the 2-dimensional stimuli to a 3D representation using three-dimensional generative adversarial networks, which is used as an input to train the Encoder(3D-to-fMRI) and Decoder(fMRI-to-3D) architecture using a supervised approach. We then use the pre-trained Encoder-Decoder architecture to perform unsupervised end-to-end training using these 3D reconstructions, and a similar unsupervised Decoder-Encoder training on unlabeled test fMRI data. 

We perform 3D reconstruction of the 2D stimuli not because we believe that it is closer to the internal representation of how spatial information is encoded in the brain but to capture that information by training our Autoencoder using a 3D representation of the stimuli and the corresponding fMRI of the stimulus.

Breakthroughs in the neural decoding are needed for designing algorithms of brain–machine interface
and prosthetics it also facilitates the understanding of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, etc. Our approach is successfully able to untangle and extract spatial information from brain activity patterns. In the future, we plan on adding high-level perceptual criteria to improve reconstruction accuracy; enabling large-scale semantic classification and add layerwise loss to the architecture.",RISHABH CHAKRABARTY,"Kartik Viswanathan, International Institute Of Information Technology, Hyderabad; Avani Gupta, International Institute Of Information Technology, Hyderabad",Manipal University (grid.411639.8),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-29 01:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 01:30:00+00:00,
recIa7ByG0wvasDQS,A family of sensitive and specific genetically-encoded GRAB sensors for spy on neuropeptides dynamics,"Neuropeptides are key signaling molecules in endocrine and nervous system, regulating virtually all physiological processes, ranging from food ingestion, sleep & circadian rhythm, to pain sensation and social behaviors. To understand their important functions in vivo, it is critical to be able to monitor neuropeptide dynamics with selectivity, sensitivity and good spatiotemporal resolution. One major hindrance to the above goal is the lack of direct, sensitive and non-invasive probes to report these bioactive peptides in vivo. Here, by tapping into GPCRs for human neuropeptides, we developed a toolbox of GRAB (GPCR activation based) sensors for neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasopressin/oxytocin, somatostatin (SST), corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), neurotensin (NT), cholecystokinin (CCK), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P and for Drosophila neuropeptides allatostatin A (AstA) and allatostatin C (AstC). These fluorescent sensors utilize native GPCR ligand binding pockets as neuropeptide sensing modules and circular-permutated GFPs as optical reporters. We have developed sensors with ultra-good selectivity for neuropeptides, with nano molecular affinity, up-to 1500% dF/F fluorescence increase upon cognate ligand application. In addition, these GRAB sensors have minimal downstream G protein coupling, or arrestin coupling, compared to their original GPCR scaffolds. We are validating these peptide sensors in slice & in vivo and extend the sensor development strategy to cover more neuropeptides in human body. The further development of these sensors and their deployment will likely significantly enhance our understanding of neuropeptide function and regulation in physiological and pathophysiological conditions.",Huan Wang,"Tongrui Qian, Peking University; Ling Wu, Peking University; Zimo ZhangRen, Peking University; Yulong Li, Peking University",Peking University (grid.11135.37),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-30 09:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 09:30:00+00:00,
recIbmUYvpPHGOWAR,Development of cortical projections to the brainstem vs. cervical spinal cord,"For skilled motor control, corticospinal neurons (CSN) must make precise connections with segmentally appropriate targets – from rostral targets in the brainstem and cervical spinal cord for forelimb control, to caudal targets in thoracic and lumbar cord for trunk and hindlimb control. However, mechanisms controlling CSN axon targeting to specific spinal segments remained largely unknown. Previous work in the Sahni lab identified that CSN axons exhibit striking axon extension specificity at the transition between cervical and thoracic spinal segments. Crim1+ CSN axons extend past this transition zone into the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord, i.e. Crim1 expression prospectively delineates thoraco-lumbar projecting CSN (CSNTL). We hypothesized that there are likely additional transition zones that function in establishing segmentally specific CSN connectivity. We have investigated the early projection targeting specificity at one such transition zone – between the brainstem and cervical spinal cord. Indeed, we find that the majority of CSN axons (60-80%) do not extend further than the brainstem early in development (P0), establishing them as brainstem-projecting CSN (CSNB). A subset of these CSNB can be molecularly identified by the expression of Kelch Like 14 (Klhl14) a member of the BTB-Kelch superfamily of proteins. In future experiments, we will test whether Klhl14 is necessary and sufficient to limit CSN axon extension to the brainstem by loss- and gain-of-function experiments. Transcriptional profiling of CSNB at this likely critical, early developmental step will also likely enable identification of additional genes that potentially control CSN axonal targeting to the brainstem.

recIexvlkkZkyGLct,Pluralistic Approach to Decoding Motor Activity from Different Brain Regions,"There exists a high degree of correlation and redundancy in the activity of neural populations across different regions of the brain; motor function is a result of such activities, coordinated over various regions. This project explored different approaches to decode activity from motor implicated regions in rodents using spike and population activity. The data, sourced from the Steinmetz dataset, was cleaned to consider recordings only from the motor related areas, while focussing on the the open loop condition - data between stimulus onset and go-cue - to avoid representations of stimulus movement. In order to identify whether neuronal spike activity accurately predicted motor function, general linear modelling (GLM) was used to decode the motor output (assumed from the wheel output) from the neural spike data from randomly sampled neurons (50) and trials (100) in different brain regions. This was implemented using cross-validated ridge regression. The length of the temporal kernel, or the spiking history required for optimal decoding, can vary from region to region; therefore, different kernel sizes, between 50ms to 250ms, were evaluated to choose the optimal kernel size for the analyses. Parallely, Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA) was implemented to compute the latent dimensions in the spiking population activity, followed by ridge regression to reconstruct the motor output and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to classify directional (left, right, or none) motor output in the lower dimensional space. It was concluded from the results that while spikes from different brain areas roughly predict the motor output to different degrees, the latent neural modes of these regions do not separate the output equally.

Today, visual arts remains a medium that communicates both the details and the beauty of the brain and it's parts.

recIvp0phXxhysCaQ,Visuomotor transformations in ventral premotor cortex during head-unrestrained reaches.,"Reaching involves a coordinated sequence of gaze, head, and arm movements toward a visual stimulus. Several studies have examined eye-head-hand coordination in the human, but the underlying neural mechanisms, especially those controlling head motion, have not been studied. We addressed this problem by recording single neurons from ventral premotor cortex (PMv) while two trained monkeys performed a reaching paradigm, that allowed unencumbered head motion and reaching in depth. Animals touched one of three central LEDs at waist level while maintaining gaze on a central fixation dot and were rewarded if they touched a target appearing at one of 15 locations in a 40° x 20° array. Preliminary analysis of 271 neurons in both monkeys showed three groups of neuronal responses. ‘Early” neurons responded during target presentation and gaze onset. “Early-late” neurons responded in a sustained way from target presentation until reach. Finally, “Late” neurons responded during pre-reach and peak at reaching. We first tested for gaze, head and hand gain fields during the different neuronal responses and found in both animals that 38% of target, gaze, pre-reach and reach-aligned responses were gain modulated by initial hand position. A small fraction of neurons showed gain fields for initial eye position (4%), and for both initial eye and hand position (6%). After removing the gain field effects, we fitted the residual data against various spatial models and found that “Early” neurons best coded the target (T) during target presentation and, during gaze shifts, preferentially coded displacement of the arm (dA). “Early-late” neurons coded dA from target presentation until reach and “Late” neurons best coded T during pre-reach and arm position in future space (Afs) during reach.

recJ6fFwWDbbujW0K,The Role of Genetic Polymorphisms in a Mouse Model of Traumatic Brain Injury and Personalized Treatment Approaches,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a serious and potentially life threatening problem. Clinicians have long noticed that certain patients recover better after TBI and we seek to identify genetic differences underlying these differences. This knowledge can be used to explore personalized approaches to treatment.

We investigated cellular and behavioral outcomes in genetically engineered mice with the BDNF Val66Met and ApoE4 polymorphism following repeated, mild TBI (rmTBI). We have found that injured Val66Met and ApoE4 carriers have a larger injury volume as assessed by MRI relative to injured Val66Val and ApoE3 carriers. We have shown that injured Val66Met carriers have increased levels of neurodegeneration, apoptosis, p-tau, activated microglia, and gliosis in the cortex and/or hippocampus at 1 and/or 21 days post injury (DPI) and that injured ApoE4 carriers have increased levels of neurodegeneration, apoptosis, activated microglia, and p-tau in the cortex and/or hippocampus at 1 and/or 21 DPI. We have also found that injured Val66Val mice have significantly more total BDNF at 21 DPI in the cortex, while ApoE3 injured mice have more total BDNF at 1 and 21 DPI in both the cortex and the hippocampus. 

Therefore, we have concluded that Val66Met and ApoE4 are risk factors for poor outcomes after rmTBI. For personalized treatments, in the Val66Met injured mice we used an AAV-BDNF virus to overexpress wildtype BDNF, while in the ApoE4 injured mice we used Bryostatin-1, a PKCε activator that has previously been shown to increase BDNF levels. AAV-BDNF treatment in Val66Met injured mice reduces astrogliosis and activated microglia at 21 DPI and increases learning and memory. Bryostatin-1 treatment in the ApoE4 injured mice reduces neurodegeneration and activated microglia at 1 DPI and improves recovery in learning and memory. This study highlights the role that personalized therapeutics may be able to play in recovery for susceptible individuals.

To date, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this effect. As the supplementary motor area (SMA) was previously implicated in coding prospective task-demands, we tested its role in producing the STIM pattern. Participants first underwent an SMA-localization session in which they tapped their fingers repeatedly while fMRI-scanned. In the next two sessions, before playing a 10-minute computer game that measured effort-engagement, participants underwent inhibitory 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the SMA, or over a control precuneus location. Three control experiments and a pretest confirmed that this task yields a STIM, which can be eliminated when the task lacks a salient end-point, or is too short. The results of the main experiment showed a more pronounced STIM following inhibitory SMA stimulation compared to control. A control analysis showed that overall level of effort was similar in both conditions, rendering alternative accounts in terms of motor inhibition unlikely. These findings are consistent with the possibility that the SMA may play a role in moment-to-moment coding of effort value, or in related sub-processes, which can cause effort to be distributed more equally over the course of a task.

recJONc8pqnqsEVL6,The Influence of Social Housing and Housing Air Pressure on Rats’ Anxiety-Related Behaviour,"Research facilities are increasingly adopting individually ventilated cages (IVCs), a standardized caging system to improve rodents’ wellbeing. IVCs may alter well-characterized displays of rodent behaviour, which poses a unique concern for psychological research. It was not previously known if IVCs alter the anxiety reducing effects of social-housing in rats. Thus, this study examined whether social-housing produced anxiety reducing effects on Long-Evans rats housed in IVCs, as indexed by their behaviour in a Modified Novelty-Induced Suppression of Feeding Test (NSFT) and the density of their oxytocin-labelled cells in the hypothalamus. This study further investigated whether maintaining the IVCs under positive or negative air pressure influenced the rats’ behavioural and neuroanatomical outcomes. It was predicted that single-housing and positive air pressure would increase the rats’ latencies to initiate snack consumption in the NSFT and reduce the density of their oxytocin-labelled cells in the hypothalamus, suggesting increased anxiety-like behaviour. Surprisingly, there was no evidence that social housing influenced the rats’ latencies to initiate snack consumption across the habituation or test trials. However, there was a marked and unexpected main effect of air pressure such that the rats housed under negative air pressure took longer to bite the palatable snack than those housed under positive air pressure. Finally, single-housed rats under positive air pressure displayed more oxytocin-labelled cells in the PaPo of the hypothalamus. These results suggest that IVCs can alter the well-characterized anxiety reducing effect of social housing in laboratory rodents, and might influence other well-characterized displays of rodent behaviour.

recJQy1rLLvWEzKJp,"pyAFQ: Automated Fiber Quantification, in Python","The white matter contains the long-range connections that form brain networks. Diffusion weighted MRI (dMRI) is an in vivo, non-invasive measurement that characterizes brain tissue and indicates  the trajectory of these connections. This data can be used to detect, characterize, and monitor brain diseases. Additionally, brain connections  change during learning and could help account for individual differences in cognition. To perform this analysis at scale, methods for delineation of the major tracts are needed. Automated Fiber Quantification in Python (pyAFQ; https://github.com/yeatmanlab/pyAFQ) is a python package that automates this process. Given dMRI data that has undergone standard preprocessing, pyAFQ will automatically perform computational tractography, delineate and segment the major tracts based on individual-level anatomical constraints, and extract the diffusion measurements along those tracks (e.g., fractional anisotropy  and mean diffusivity). We call this entire process tractometry.

To demonstrate the use of these methods, we compared tract profiles generated by pyAFQ to the original, matlab-based AFQ software. They are in close agreement and have similar test-retest intersubject reliability.

recJfFPQrKKJeUbCi,Modeling of behavioral tasks for data sharing using state machines,"Rigorous descriptions of experimental methods are critical for reproducing protocols, comparing different studies, performing data analyses, and building accurate computational models to predict and explain results. Behavioral tasks are a critical component of many neurophysiology studies, but published task descriptions vary greatly in the amount of information they convey about task structure and logic, and this lack of standardization can make task descriptions difficult to interpret and insufficient to reproduce the methods and analyses. 
Our goal is to build a schema for representation of behavioral tasks that is machine-readable and uses existing standards and formats for specification; facilitates comparison of task structure and logic; permits task emulation for testing and debugging of experimental designs; and captures the essential metadata for performing relevant data analyses. This schema will be used to extend the NWB:N data standard (http://www.nwb.org) for storing task descriptions and metadata.
Our approach was to model tasks as finite state machines (FSMs). Many types of tasks can be modeled by FSMs, and many common software packages for designing and executing tasks for neurophysiology studies use an FSM framework. We used MagicDraw, a commercial systems engineering software package that includes a freeware version, to build executable task models. MagicDraw was chosen because it allows for the graphical design of state machines for task logic, enables task emulation with model outputs for later analyses, and uses existing UML standards for building and exporting FSM descriptions. 
We have developed a set of task models in MagicDraw that cover the most common task designs for rodent neurophysiology. We will demo some of these models and present the results of simulations. We will discuss what FSM task models can and can’t capture, and hope to stimulate discussion of essential metadata for behavioral task description and sharing, and to discuss features to include in task representations that would be most useful  for facilitating sharing in the community.

recJwSWbas6GdOBvu,Synaptopathy in Frontotemporal Dementia: investigating the pathogenic role of mutant CHMP2B ,"Frontotemporal dementia is the second most common form of early-onset dementia and senile neurodegenerative disease. One rare subtype is caused by a mutation in the gene CHMP2B. CHMP2B is a subunit of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) and CHMP2B mutation causes defects in certain protein degradation pathways. The ESCRT pathway is involved in degradation of synaptic vesicle proteins, and preliminary data by E. Clayton and S. Schorge demonstrates that several synaptic proteins accumulate in brains of aged mutant CHMP2B mice compared to age-matched controls. Synaptic vesicle protein accumulation would inevitably cause synaptic dysfunction, an effect not well studied in frontotemporal dementia. This project aimed to characterise this probable ‘synapto-pathogenic’ feature of CHMP2B-frontotemporal dementia, by investigating the neuronal subcellular localisation of mutant CHMP2B protein and examining the relative synaptic vesicle protein levels at early postnatal stages. Using immunofluorescence microscopy in mouse cortical neurons transfected with mutant CHMP2B, we found that mutant CHMP2B forms puncta which co-localise with presynaptic marker SV2. Wildtype CHMP2B shows diffuse staining, but also co-localises with SV2. Cycloheximide chase and subsequent western blot were conducted to inhibit protein synthesis in protein lysates and isolate levels of the synaptic vesicle proteins synapsin, synaptophysin and SV2 remaining after protein degradation. While no significant difference was found between mutant lysates and wildtype controls, a surprising trend of increased protein accumulation in wildtype and decreased protein accumulation in mutant samples was observed. Interestingly, an SV2 isoform not observed in wildtype samples accumulated in mutant samples. These findings demonstrate that mutant CHMP2B is localised to the presynaptic terminal, but point to the need for further investigation of its mechanism of action, including isoform-specific protein degradation. Understanding the pathogenic agency of mutant CHMP2B at the synapse will be useful for identifying therapeutic targets in CHMP2B-frontotemporal dementia.

recJwd1sTrVQza5Cv,Encoding Complex Shapes in Memory: The VAE_BP Model of Working Memory,"Current computational models of working memory (WM) lack the ability to account for how memory communicates with visual semantics, therefore these models do not allow for how familiarity impact encoding. We created a model that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE; An & Cho, 2015) with the Binding Pool (BP) model (Swan & Wyble 2014) of WM and had it learn a colorized version of MNIST (LeCun et al.,1998). This new VAE-BP model shows how WM encoding and retrieval is mediated through visual semantics. Additionally, The shared resource pool of neurons in the model could store varying degrees of information about the specific shape or color of a single item, as well as its categorical label.
A VAE structure was used with layers of input =28x28x3, L1=512, L2=256, L3= 4 + 4, L4= 256, L5=512, output=28x28x3 neurons respectively. The latent space (L3) was composed of two distinct maps for representing shape and color separately to be able to apply top-down control on items’ features. The shape and color maps activations were combined at L4 and then used to reconstruct the input image.  
After we colorized the MNIST images using 10 distinct colors with minor random variations, we trained the VAE with two separate objective functions for the shape and the color such that only one loss function was active for each batch. Four radial basis function kernel SVMs were applied to the color and shape maps of 10 trained models to test whether shape and color were partially disentangled by the two objective functions. As expected, representations in the shape map produced more accurate classification of shape than color on average (88.6% vs. 12.8%) and vice versa (95.8% vs. 18.1%).
To represent complex patterns of digits in memory, a BP layer with 100 neurons was bidirectionally connected to L1, L2 or the latent space (VAE_BP). The results demonstrated the VAE_BP ability in robust classification accuracy of the shape and the color maps (76.8% and 84.6%). Applying the BP transformation to the L1 and L2 instead of the latent space, resulted in 25% and 38.1% shape accuracy and 40% and 44.2% color accuracy respectively. In conclusion, weights on the dimensions allowed the BP to store different levels of precision for shape and color which affects both the quality of a reconstructed image and the level of classification accuracy from the latent space. Moreover, the WM model is able to store and reconstruct novel patterns (e.g. Fashion MNIST images when training was only done on digit MNIST), but is more efficient in storing familiar information.

Previous studies have demonstrated that neurons in a given brain region mostly exhibit either short or long intrinsic timescales. In this study, we sought to identify populations of neurons that accumulate information over different timescales in the mouse brain, and to characterize their functions in the context of a visual discrimination task. Thus, we separately examined the neural population dynamics of neurons with long or short intrinsic timescales across different brain regions.  More specifically, we looked at the decoding performance of these neural populations, aligned to different task variables (stimulus onset, movement and choice probability). Taken together, our population level findings support the hypothesis that long intrinsic timescale neurons encode abstract variables related to decision formation.  Furthermore, we evaluated the time constants of individual neurons at different epochs during the task, and found that many neurons exhibited multiple timescales in their response. These timescales were consistently longer after the animal formed its decision (e.g. during wheel movement), and the longest timescales were observed in frontal regions and in the thalamus. Finally, we also found a significant correlation between the functions primarily subserved by individual neurons, and their intrinsic timescales.

We recently showed that a perceptual confirmation bias drives this effect and arises from approximate online inference in a hierarchical model in which expectations influence sensory inferences (Lange et al. 2020). In this study, we investigated whether similar biases exist due to biased eye-movements. Are saccades to peripheral stimuli biased by existing beliefs about the correct category? 
To test this hypotheses, we designed two 2AFC experiments. In Experiment 1, the subject first fixated on a band passed gabor stimulus either oriented +45 degrees or -45 degrees while two or three stimuli (fixed per trial, random across trials) appeared in the periphery and the subject had to saccade to one of them. After three such saccades, the subject had to report the orientation in majority. In Experiment 2, a subject saw 18 black horizontal/vertical ellipses on a gray background and made eye-movements freely for 1.5 secs before choosing the orientation in majority.

In both experiments we found evidence that subjects are biased to saccade to targets that confirm their belief about the correct category. The pattern of subject responses can be explained by an approximate inference model of information maximization (extending Yang et al. 2016).

recK5OgVa97MLfPaR,The contribution of anxiety to spatial memory deficits in the TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer’s disease,"Anxiety and spatial navigation impairment are both early markers of Alzheimer’s disease. The TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer’s disease has previously shown increased anxiety-like behaviors at 4 months, and spatial impairments at 7 to 10 months of age. The connection between anxiety and working memory is important to consider as previous research has highlighted the negative association between anxiety and performance on working memory tasks. In light of this association, we sought to determine whether elevated levels of anxiety-like behaviors in TgF344-AD rats may be an early predictor of performance in a spatial working memory task. TgF344-AD rats (n = 16) and F344 controls (n = 12) were assessed across three time-points (4–5, 7–8, 10–11 months). The match-to-place water task and the elevated plus maze were used to evaluate spatial working memory and anxiety-like behaviors, respectively. We hypothesize that the magnitude of anxiety will be a large predictor of spatial working memory performance in TgF344-AD rats. This research will help inform future studies that examine contributing factors of spatial navigation impairment in AD, and may be useful for the development of targeted treatments.

recK99nEEbdSd77QU,Computational investigation of optimal sub-goal settings under myopic planning horizons,"Humans have been known to break down their final goals into smaller sub-goals which involve planning upto a limited number of steps ahead in time. This is mainly driven due to inability to precisely plan much later into the future and thus a study of optimal sub-goal settings under myopic planning horizons is of interest to us. We computationally study the behaviour of three different myopic planning agents in the game of Tower of Hanoi, which has a long history of being used in neuropsychological studies. Our motivation for using the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for our simulations, is that it captures the conditional dependence in tasks and its effect in overall planning, which we observe very often in daily planning, for example, the progress in other tasks are dependent on partial completion of few tasks termed as “blockers”. The three myopic planning agents used in our study are as follows: (1) Agent A plans “h” steps ahead, and then chooses the plan for which the state after “h” steps is most similar to the final goal. (2) Agent B first sets the subgoal to move the largest misplaced disk to its target location and then plans “h” steps ahead to try to find a way to accomplish that subgoal. It then repeats its cycle of goal-setting, planning, and plan execution until all disks are in their target locations. (3) Agent C is identical to Agent B except that it sets its subgoal by resolving to move a randomly selected disk to its target location. We discuss the convergence of these agents on varying planning horizons “h” on two different final goals: (a) a tower in a random location, (b) another randomly chosen configuration. Our results show that Agent B outperforms other agents in both the final goals and is conjectured to achieve the final goal with a sufficiently long planning horizon h>2(n-1), where n is the number of disks. This directly translates to our understanding that taking the “blocker” task to completion, upon which other tasks are conditionally dependent, is an optimal goal setting in a myopic planning horizon. Currently, the agents assume complete knowledge of all the possible states after “h” steps via the discrete Sierpinski Gasket. In future works, we can decay this model predictive power with the  planning horizon “h” and validating this work with data from a randomized controlled trial with human participants.",Pranav Mahajan,"Pranav Mahajan, BITS Pilani University - K.

recK9D1OTOULOsSXV,Neuromodulation enhances plasticity in a rat model of cochlear implant use,"Rates of auditory perceptual learning with cochlear implants are highly variable across patients. Adaptation to cochlear implants is believed to require neuroplasticity within the central auditory system. However, mechanisms by which behavioral training enables plasticity and improves outcomes are poorly understood. Here we hypothesize that neural mechanisms promoting plasticity in the rat auditory system are key to optimizing cochlear implant usage. Specifically, we examined the effect of pairing locus coeruleus stimulation with an auditory stimulus on auditory learning when the animal has to relearn a tone identification task (self-initiated, go/no-go) using a cochlear implant. Initial training was done using acoustic stimuli in normal hearing animals. Animals were then bilaterally deafened, unilaterally cochlear-implanted, and retrained with the new target delivered by intracochlear electrical stimulation.  Prior to daily behavioral training sessions, rats underwent 5-10 min pairing sessions either with optogenetic locus coeruleus or sham stimulation. Pairing accelerated learning with cochlear implants. We then conducted multi-unit recordings in the auditory cortex to assess responses to the cochlear implant. Animals that had been trained with the cochlear implant had increased activation of the cortex, and those that underwent pairing had a sharper representation of the target cochlear implant channel. We used fiber photometry to monitor activity of noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons. During auditory learning, cochlear implanted animals display dynamic locus coeruleus activity, specifically during the acquisition of the meaning of reward relevant tones. These studies indicate that neuromodulation can play a powerful role in shaping outcomes with cochlear implant use and training.",Erin Glennon,"Angela Zhu, NYU School of Medicine; Mario Svirsky, NYU School of Medicine; and Robert C.

support emotional, relative to neutral, memory. However, it is still unknown how these
two structures interact during successful encoding of unpleasant information. We used
direct intracranial recordings from 15 patients with medication-resistant epilepsy while
they encoded (day 1) and later retrieved (after 24 h, day 2) unpleasant and neutral
complex scenes from the IAPS database. All patients had intracranial depth electrodes
implanted into the amygdala and 8 patients also in the ipsilateral hippocampus.
Investigating the oscillatory responses associated with the subsequent memory of
scenes, we found that successful emotional memory formation produced in the
amygdala (n=8) a local broadband gamma activity (80-135 Hz) starting at around
400ms. By contrast, at around 500ms hippocampal (n=8) gamma responses (50-75 Hz)
were associated with successful encoding of both unpleasant and neutral scenes. We
further found theta oscillations in the amygdala influencing in a unidirectional way
hippocampus theta responses to emotional stimuli. Importantly, during successful
encoding of unpleasant scenes, the hippocampus gamma activity coupled to the
amygdala theta in a specific manner. We indeed found that the coupling occurred with a
consistent phase difference of ~1.67 radians during successful and unsuccessful
encoding of unpleasant scenes. Finally, using amplitude envelope cross-correlation as a
proxy of synchrony strength between the amygdala and the hippocampus we found
transient broadband gamma (60-120 Hz) connectivity. The amygdala gamma also leads
the hippocampus gamma during successful encoding of unpleasant scenes.
Our results show a unique phase code for negative memory formation in humans and
demonstrate that the amygdala facilitates memory encoding in the hippocampus within
a unique time window of ~37ms on which hippocampal gamma amplitude peaks have
to occur to form successfully emotional memories.",Manuela Costa,"Diego Lozano-Soldevilla, Laboratory for Clinical Neuroscience, Center for Biomedical Technology, University Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Antonio Gil-Nagel, Epilepsy Unit, Department of Neurology, Hospital Ruber Internacional, Madrid, Spain; Rafael Toledano, Epilepsy Unit, Department of Neurology, Hospital Ruber Internacional, Madrid, Spain; Carina Oehrn, Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Giessen and Marburg, Baldingerstrasse, 35043 Marburg, Germany, Center for Mind, Brain and Behavior (CMBB), Philipps-University Marburg, Marburg, Germany; Mar Yebra, Laboratory for Clinical Neuroscience, Center for Biomedical Technology, University Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Costantino Mendez-Bertolo, Laboratory for Clinical Neuroscience, Center for Biomedical Technology, University Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Johannes Sarnthein, Neurosurgery Department, University Hospital and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Nikolai Axmacher, Department of Neuropsychology, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Psychology, Ruhr University Bochum, Universitaetsstrasse, 150, 44801 Bochum, Germany; Stephan Moratti, Department of Experimental Psychology, Complutense University of Madrid, Spain; Bryan A.

recKFw7i08zuFMT9M,Large-scale calcium imaging of spontaneous activity in larval zebrafish reveals signatures of criticality,"Neural networks in the brain may self-organise such that they operate near criticality, that is, poised on the boundary between phases of order and disorder. Models of neural networks tuned close to criticality are optimal in terms of dynamic range, information transmission, information storage and computational adaptability. Much of the experimental evidence for criticality in the brain has come from studies of neural spiking data recorded from tissue cultures or anaesthetised animals using microelectrode arrays, or from studies of mesoscopic-scale neural activity using magnetic resonance imaging or electroencephalograms. These approaches are inherently limited either by under-sampling of the neural population or by coarse spatial resolution.

In this study, we investigated neural criticality by utilising the unique properties of the larval zebrafish that enable whole-brain imaging of neural activity in vivo and without anaesthetic. We used 2-photon calcium imaging to observe truly spontaneous activity, and extracted neural activity data at single-cell resolution via state-of-the-art image segmentation. Our data comprise fluorescence time series for large populations of neurons from 3-dimensional volumetric recordings of spontaneous activity in the optic tectum and cerebellum of larval zebrafish with pan-neuronal expression of GCaMP6s (n=5; approx. 10000 neurons per fish). Neuronal avalanche statistics revealed power-law relationships and scale-invariant avalanche shape collapse which are consistent with crackling noise dynamics from a 3-dimensional random field Ising model. This result provides the first evidence of criticality in the brain from large-scale in vivo neural activity at single cell resolution. Our findings demonstrate the potential of larval zebrafish as a model for the investigation of critical phenomena in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders that may perturb the brain away from criticality.

Enhancement of task-relevant information requires flexible allocation of attentional resources, but it is still a mystery how this is operationalised in the brain. We investigated how attentional mechanisms operate in situations where multiple stimuli are presented in the same location and at the same time. In two experiments, participants performed a challenging two-back task on different types of visual stimuli that were presented simultaneously and superimposed over each other. Using electroencephalography and multivariate decoding, we analysed the effect of attention on the neural coding of each individual stimulus. Whole brain neural responses contained considerable information about both the attended and unattended stimuli, even though they were presented simultaneously and represented in overlapping receptive fields. As expected, attention enhanced stimulus-related information contained in the neural responses, but this enhancement was evident earlier for stimuli that were presented at smaller sizes. Our results show that early neural responses to stimuli in fast-changing displays contain remarkable detail about the sensory environment but are also modulated by attention in a manner dependent on perceptual characteristics of the relevant stimuli.

Differences in perceptual awareness can arise from i) evoked brain responses for different perceptual outcomes and ii) from the pre-stimulus differences in brain activity. Cyclic variations of bodily signals can also influence perceptual awareness: baroreceptor activity during the systolic phase interferes with sensory stimulus processing, and the pre-stimulus response of the brain to the heartbeat (HEP) differs for stimuli subsequently seen or not. We presented subjects with near-threshold stimuli (Gabors overlaid with random-dot-noise) and compared i) the event related potentials (ERPs) and ii) the HEP for the same stimuli when consciously seen and not. ERPs for seen and unseen differed as a function of cardiac phase: early sensory potentials (P1) were modulated during systole, while later cognitive potentials (VAN) were modulated during diastole. The HEP amplitude, topographic and source space differences indicated that the default-mode-network is recruited for subsequently unseen stimuli and that the saliency-network is recruited for subsequently seen stimuli.

However, obtaining MR images of the brain often takes several minutes, which could be prohibitively long for studying neuronal activities in the brain. This process has been sped up by applying conventional reconstruction methods, such as parallel imaging and compressed sensing (Jaspan et al., Golay et al.). However, these methods are limited in accelerating MRI scans. Thus, developing an effective reconstruction method to further accelerate brain MRIs would help neuroscience researchers observe neuronal processes in a noninvasive manner. This could also result in more data that may support computational modeling of brain structure and function. 
In this study, we investigate machine learning, in particular deep learning in reconstructing MR images. One prominent deep learning model is the U-Net (Ronneberger et al.) which transforms a noisy image into a clearer image, ideally suitable for use by neuroscientists and radiologists. However, most MRI machines today acquire data with multiple coils simultaneously, and the conventional U-Net does not take into account information from multiple coils; it operates once the data from multiple coils have been combined into a single image. This may mean a loss of valuable information for imaging reconstruction. We are experimenting with extending the U-Net to account for the additional information from multiple coils. We train these U-Net variations on the fastMRI dataset, a large corpus with brain MRI data (Zbontar et al.).

recKMzTGGWSqONWrY,A systematic review of stakeholder perspectives on cognitive effects of brain stimulation,"Whether implemented in deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) systems, or bidirectional brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), targeted electrical stimulation of the brain is an emerging technology for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Despite the promise of neurostimulation, there is an accumulating body of literature on side effects, mostly on motor, psychiatric or psychosocial effects. Cognitive side effects of neurostimulation have been relatively understudied and underreported by patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers (Mehanna, Bajwa, Fernandez, & Shukla, 2017). Several neuroethics scholars have advocated for complementing clinical measures with qualitative methods that characterize complex, context-specific changes in language, memory, and other cognitive processes following brain stimulation (Shook, Galvagni, & Giordano, 2014). Additionally, there is increasing scientific and medical interest in the use of brain stimulation techniques to treat disorders of cognition, such as dementia (Hampson et al., 2018). Reviews of brain-computer interface (BCI) studies using social research methods have proven useful to guide future qualitative research (Kögel, Jox, & Friedrich, 2020; Kögel, Schmid, Jox, & Friedrich, 2019). However, qualitative brain stimulation studies where neural activity is directly modulated to affect cognition have not been the focus of these reviews. 
We conducted a systematic review of literature on stakeholder perspectives on cognitive effects of neurostimulation. A PubMed database search of qualitative studies on brain stimulation yielded 34 unique datasets from 41 publications that include quoted responses to open-ended interview or survey questions. Of these 34 datasets, 14 (41%) had at least one associated publication addressing actual or expected cognitive effects. Patient-reported cognitive effects were logged in 7 (50%) of the 14 datasets, yet only one (14%) of these seven datasets indicated that patients were asked about cognitive effects. On the other hand, 5 (36%) of the 14 datasets logged provider-reported cognitive effects and four (80%) out of these 5 datasets asked providers about expectations or views of cognitive enhancement. Similarly, quoted providers mention that brain stimulation worsens, restores, and enhances cognition with equal frequency while patients describe that brain stimulation actually worsens cognition slightly more than it restores. Our findings suggest that previous qualitative studies on brain stimulation lack focused attention to cognitive changes—specifically patient-reported cognitive impairment. As such, future studies of neurostimulation should aim to more consistently and rigorously evaluate cognitive effects.

For example, the long-term effect of cannabis is unclear on tasks that involve the inhibition of ingrained actions to avoid accidents, such as in driving or operating machinery. To investigate the effect of cannabis on various brain functions, we created a battery of cognitively demanding, visual-spatial and visual-motor tasks. Here, we discuss preliminary findings of one of the tasks in this battery: a speeded Go/No-Go task (80% go, 20% no-go) that measures the ability to inhibit motor impulses. Task performance is analyzed by comparing the proportion of false alarms on no-go trials as well as reaction times on hits and false alarms in frequent cannabis users (N=9) and non-users (N=63). Our findings indicate no difference in task performance on the speeded Go/No-Go task for frequent users of cannabis, versus non-users. These results may suggest the absence of a negative effect of cannabis on performance of impulse inhibition.

Moreover, online experimental design is a critical scientific paradigm which necessitates the development of automated and scalable tools for analyzing a stream of data.

Motivated by these applications and recent advances in the field of computer vision and statistics we have developed automated and semi-automated pipelines for extracting information from C. elegans microscopy videos.

0) probabilistic inference for constructing a statistical atlas.
1) point set registration for aligning the atlas to an image.
2) permutation inference for probabilistic neuron assignments.
3) optimal transport for probabilistic segmentation and tracking.
4) matrix factorization for demixing calcium signals from deforming videos.

Categorizing the analysis techniques as a pipeline of atlas building, registration, segmentation and signal extraction is general and can be applied to virtually every single animal model and emerging imaging modality.

recKTHNittdD7U2tv,Personalized Brain State Targeting via Reinforcement Learning,"We propose a novel use of reinforcement learning as an active closed-loop assistive system that learns in real time to lead any brain state to a given goal state. Previous open- and closed-loop systems to manipulate brain states are generally passive in the sense that they are trained offline from data collected from a population but are not tailored or adapted for any individuals. Offline adaptation per individual if at all is very slow. Adaptation, and the speed of adaptation, is critical in most applications where manipulation of brain states is performed because poor initial performance and long training periods are barriers to BCI adaptation and success. Reinforcement learning is a sequential decision-making paradigm in which the system learns to map situations to optimal actions via trial-and-error interactions with the world to maximize a reward signal. Crucially, this reward signal is a form of evaluative feedback, for instance, proportional to how far the current state is from the goal state. This is in contrast to instructive feedback in the supervised learning paradigm, where the correct action is assumed known. We propose modeling brain state manipulation as a sequential decision-making problem, wherein a system takes real-time EEG data as input and uses audio-visual cues to start from any brain state and reach a physiologically-objective goal state such as a particular oscillation frequency or a deep-sleep state. We show a proof of concept example using a consumer-based EEG device. We believe such an active closed-loop system would have a large impact in assistive applications ranging from helping critically-ill patients fall asleep to helping everyday stressed-out individuals relax.

Further, do task and familiarity with the competing images influence eye movements? Here, we investigated the direction of the first saccade to characterize and analyze the global visual salience of competing stimuli. Participants freely observed pairs of images while eye movements were recorded. The pairs balanced the combinations of new and already seen images, as well as task and task-free trials. Then, we trained a logistic regression model that accurately predicted the location—left or right image—of the first fixation for each stimulus pair, accounting too for the influence of task, familiarity, and lateral bias. The coefficients of the model provided a reliable measure of global salience, which we contrasted with two distinct local salience models, GBVS and Deep Gaze. The lack of correlation of the behavioral data with the former and the small correlation with the latter indicate that global salience cannot be explained by the feature-driven local salience of images. Further, the influence of task and familiarity was rather small, and we reproduced the previously reported left-sided bias.

We also observed developmental connectivity changes that are consistent between animals but different among neurons, altering the strengths of existing connections and creating additional connections.

The most brain-like models are Bayesian Networks because they display logic and control through priors and likelihoods, but are neither connectionist (implementable with neurons) nor scalable because distributions must be calculated.  Neural Networks are connectionist during recognition and scalable, but likelihoods and priors are not accessible and distributions are embedded into synaptic weights during learning through a complex rehearsal mechanism emulating shuffling casino card dealers. Unfortunately this rehearsal is difficult to model with neurons (thus not connectionist during learning) and the nuances of rehearsal for synaptic weight learning are commonly ignored in models, confounding understanding.  Moreover neither of the above models shows brain phenomena such as Network-Wide Bursting (NWB). If real brains at a resting state are presented with a new or unexpected stimulus, neurons show a fast increase in activation (NWB of many neurons) followed by a slower inhibition, until the network settles again to a resting state.  We introduce Braisian Networks with connectionist regulatory feedback connections that iterate during recognition and essentially estimate distributions.  They allow flexible brain-like learning of likelihoods without rehearsal or distributions thus are connectionist both during learning and recognition.  We demonstrate flexibility by learning common data sets in an order that is not suited for neural networks and the NWB phenomenon as a fundamental outcome of the network.  Our goal is for neuroscientists to adopt more rigorous brain-like connectionist models both during recognition and learning to accelerate the field forward.",Tsvi Achler,,Optimizing Mind,Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-27 21:15:00+00:00,2020-10-27 21:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/1It6uOOw4_8
recKfOQs0wCsfvUNp,Perceptual and semantic boundaries create events in auditory streams,"While our perceptual experience unfolds seemingly continuously over time, episodic memory preserves distinct events for storage and recollection. Therefore, a critical question is how the brain segments information into structured event representations. Previous work shows that contextual stability (in stimulus properties and goal-state) serves to temporally bind individual items into composite events; however, this has primarily been studied using visual and spatial memory paradigms. The current study adapts these paradigms in order to test the role of both perceptual and semantic contexts for event segmentation of auditory streams. Our results replicate the findings in other sensory modalities – finding greater within-event temporal memory for items within perceptually bounded events. Furthermore, we show that naturally adopted mnemonic strategies during encoding selectively drive temporal memory. Finally, our analyses reveal that semantic boundaries strongly drive temporal binding effects as a function of semantic similarity within-events and across-event categorical transitions. These findings provide evidence that contextual stability may drive temporal binding in a modality independent manner and supports a role for non-sensory mechanisms in event segmentation.

recKvzCOEjY352jTh,Temporal graphs reveal the subset of spikes informative of visual stimulus,"Which spikes give rise to a percept is a key question in neuroscience. Yet, spiking activity varies from trial to trial despite conditions being ostensibly identical, making identification of  the information conveying spikes difficult. One approach is to use functional connectivity, i.e. the pairwise statistical dependency between neurons and then identify how these functional connections dynamically manifest, summarized as a temporal graph (TG). We used 2-photon calcium imaging to study populations of pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex in response to 12 directions of drifting gratings and inferred spikes from resultant fluorescence. We then computed a functional connectivity matrix (FN) for each of the 12 directions as lagged mutual information between each pair of neurons over the full time course of stimulus presentation - i.e. the ‘static’ FN for each direction. Next we intersected the static FN with the spiking activity to build a TG: a tensor summarizing which spikes are an expression of functional connectivity. We find that these TGs are sparse and their density profiles are correlated in trials of the same direction. We further parse TGs according to four edge types, based on similarity between different grating directions. We find that a specific subnetwork, capturing interactions that are strong for one stimulus and weak for similar stimuli, is sparse with strong weights and displays a balance in feedforward and recurrent spiking patterns. Decoding only from spikes that are a manifestation of this subgraph yields better performance, as compared to decoding from raw spiking activity and from other subgraphs that capture fully unique or fully shared edges between directions. Our results demonstrate that despite trial-to-trial variability, the time evolution of spikes in response to visual stimuli follows a predictable trajectory and a specific subset of the spikes are needed to successfully decode information about direction.",Maayan Levy,"Jeff Kaihao Guo, University of Chicago; Jason N.

In this paper, I synthesize insights from neuroscience, human development, and computer science to present a new mechanistic formulation of “intelligence”—as well as a new strategy for engineering it. The key hypothesis of this view is that all cognitive processes, including sensing, planning, logic, memory, and even consciousness, can be represented as information processing under a massively-parallel network of probabilistic circuits that model unknown processes. Each of these model-building circuits uses its input information, along with certain preset parameters, to attempt to produce the same output that the unknown process does.

recL3I6tzdQDYoc0I,Chrna5 is essential for a rapid and protected response to optogenetic release of endogenous acetylcholine in prefrontal cortex,"Optimal attention performance requires cholinergic modulation of corticothalamic neurons in the prefrontal cortex. These pyramidal cells express specialized nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing the alpha5 subunit encoded by the Chrna5 gene. Disruption of this gene impairs attention, but the advantage alpha5 confers on endogenous cholinergic signaling is unknown. To ascertain this underlying mechanism, we used optogenetics to stimulate cholinergic afferents in prefrontal cortex brain slices from compound-transgenic wild-type and Chrna5 knock-out mice of both sexes. These electrophysiological experiments identify that Chrna5 is critical for the rapid onset of the postsynaptic cholinergic response. Loss of alpha5 slows cholinergic excitation and delays its peak, and these effects are observed in two different optogenetic mouse lines. Disruption of Chrna5 does not otherwise perturb the magnitude of the response, which remains strongly mediated by nicotinic receptors and tightly controlled by autoinhibition via muscarinic M2 recep- tors. However, when conditions are altered to promote sustained cholinergic receptor stimulation, it becomes evident that alpha5 also works to protect nicotinic responses against desensitization. Rescuing Chrna5 disruption thus presents the double challenge of improving the onset of nicotinic signaling without triggering desensitization. Here, we identify that an agonist for the unorthodox alpha4-alpha4 nicotinic binding site can allosterically enhance the cholinergic pathway considered vital for attention. Treatment with NS9283 restores the rapid onset of the postsynaptic cholinergic response without triggering desensitization. Together, this work demonstrates the advantages of speed and resilience that Chrna5 confers on endogenous cholinergic signaling, defining a critical window of interest for cue detection and attentional processing.",Sridevi Venkatesan,"Evelyn K Lambe, Department of Physiology, University of Toronto",University of Toronto (grid.17063.33),"Theme B: Neural Excitability, Synapses, and Glia",Traditional talk,2020-10-26 22:30:00+00:00,2020-10-26 22:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/e_vh7-8CVwk

recL8dRQFfMwiIPBP,"Visual mismatch responses are a product of surprise, but not fulfilled expectations","We are constantly forming expectations about our sensory environments. These expectations facilitate our decision-making and allow us to detect unusual events. Accordingly, studies using visual oddball designs have reported enhanced neural responses to surprising, compared to expected, images. Influential predictive processing models posit that these ‘mismatch effects’ arise from both suppression of responses to expected stimuli and enhanced responses to surprising stimuli. Existing studies have confirmed the role of surprise, but have confounded effects of fulfilled expectations with those of stimulus repetition, which mimic hypothesised expectation effects. We isolated and quantified effects of fulfilled expectations and surprise using a novel oddball design based on Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS). This design controls for stimulus repetition effects while entraining participants’ expectations toward seeing specific images. We presented stimulation sequences consisting of the same face image presented at a rate of 6 Hz while recording EEG. Every 7th face was replaced by one of two different face identities, here termed the ‘oddball’ stimulus. The probability of a particular face image being the oddball ranged between 10% and 90% across sequences, in steps of 10%, including an ‘expectation neutral’ condition whereby Face A and B were each presented as 50% of oddball stimuli. Oddball-evoked ERPs were more negative between 200-300ms following surprising (10-40% probability) oddballs, compared to expected (60-90%) oddballs. However, expected oddball-evoked ERPs did not differ from neutral (50%) oddballs. Our findings indicate that visual mismatch responses reflect the detection of unusual events, but not the suppression of responses to expected inputs.

However, neural systems tend to be intrinsically noisy and near the edge of chaos, making them challenging to capture with non-divergent, i.e., globally stable models.
With some arguing that mental illnesses may be fundamentally understood as disorders of neural dynamics, it remains crucial to learn models from neural data that capture the underlying dynamics and are interpretable and amenable to dynamical systems analysis tools.
As a remedy, we introduce a piece-wise linear recurrent neural network model that is by design stable and is trained by a simple, fast and scalable variational inference algorithm.

recLIlZkWrTPUboqA,Synaptic Dynamics as Convolutional Units,"Communication in the nervous system is largely based on temporal sequences of action potentials. A central feature of this communication is that the efficacy of action potentials is variable on short (10 ms - 10 s) time scales. These short-term plasticity (STP) dynamics differ markedly across connections and strongly regulate how action potentials are being communicated to postsynaptic partners. 

Traditionally, STP dynamics are mathematically described by simple mechanistic models, such as the Tsodyks-Markram model, in which the parameters correspond to biophysical mechanisms. Optimizing the model parameters to best describe experimental data therefore yields an estimate of biophysical properties. However, such traditional models fail to capture the diversity of STP dynamics that are experimentally observed in response to complex stimulation patterns.

Here, we are willing to sacrifice some of the model’s biophysical interpretability in order to phenomenologically describe the large range of experimentally observed dynamics. To this end, we develop a flexible mathematical framework based on a linear-nonlinear operation. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the resulting Spike Response Plasticity (SRP) model is more adaptable than previous models. We show that the model captures short-term facilitation, short-term depression, biphasic plasticity, as well as supralinear facilitation and post-burst potentiation. Additionally, using standard gradient descent algorithms, model parameters can be inferred accurately with limited amount of experimental data.

Our model therefore provides a more flexible alternative to traditional mechanistic STP models. It can be used for large-scale characterization of synaptic dynamics and can easily be implemented in large-scale network models.

Across both age groups, behavior followed a characteristic pattern as a function of cue viewing time, with most trials resulting in errors if they were initiated shortly after stimulus appearance. However, reaction times were not correlated with the neural responses to the visual stimulus but to the activity of motor and visuomotor neurons that appeared after the initial response to the stimulus.

recLSQ0iTwDg22BxY,Movement vigor in Rats,"Choice between two actions (e.g. reaching for different rewards) can be used to assess internal motivation in animals as they will select the choice that has the higher subjective utility. Vigor of movement is a finer indicator that reflects continuous subjective utility.
The utility of a distant reward is dependent on its subjective reward, the amount of effort needed to reach it (movement cost) and temporal discounting (cost of time). High utility rewards make it worthwhile to expend more energy in order to reach it sooner, leading to an increase in movement vigor. 
The goal of this project is to understand how rats balance reward, movement and temporal cost to maximize their reward rate.
We have developed an automated foraging task in which water-restricted rats have to run in a 120 x 15 cm enclosed corridor to get rewards (water). Water dispensers are located on each end of the apparatus and a drop of water is delivered each time the rat goes to the other side of the apparatus, forcing the rat to run back and forth to get subsequent rewards.
We are carefully manipulating the quantity of the reward (size of the water drops that they can get) and the cost (distance they have to run in order to get it), and are looking at the rat’s vigor of movement (speed as they run across the apparatus). 
We show that rats elicit behaviors that are in line with an optimal control of effort expenditure and reward gain ratio: e.g., if we increase the quantity of reward on one side of the apparatus, they run faster towards the side where the reward is bigger. 
We also started developing a reinforcement learning based mathematical model in which artificial rats are performing the same task, and elicit similar behavioral results.

However, how motor circuits support an animal’s flexible updating of choice behaviors in the face of an abrupt change of rules remains poorly understood. Using the genetic rabies virus tracing method, we first searched for brain areas projecting to motor cortex in the rat and found that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is one of the major sources of projections to premotor cortex (M2 cortex) specifically. Based on this anatomical observation, we hypothesized that this cortico-cortical projection is involved in some cognitive-mnemonic aspect of animal’s planning and the execution of hierarchical (e.g., sequential) choice behaviors. To examine its potential role, we developed a behavioral task that we named conditional action sequence task (CAS -task) in which the rule dictating an animal’s response for reward is sustained within a block and is changed between consecutive blocks. Silencing excitatory neurons in ACC using an inhibitory DREADD virus disrupted an animal’s ability to flexibly adjust its choice responses following the rule switches in the task without affecting its performance in tone cue discrimination (sensory capability) or motor execution (motor capability). The same chemogenetic manipulation (silencing of excitatory neurons in ACC) altered physiological neural activity in motor cortex. Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition at ACC terminals in M2 cortex using bilateral cannulas showed a disruption of the performance of sequential choice actions in the CAS -task.

The interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period produces a weak, approximately random signal which can be exploited to estimate causal transmission probability.

recLYWsSbwwwoC082,Relating the power law decay of power and eigenvalue spectra of neural population data,"    Neural data of all kinds exhibit 1/f-like statistics, which is often interpreted as evidence that the brain operates at the edge of criticality. Indeed, systems at criticality display scale-free temporal and spatial correlations, typically characterized by power law distributions of avalanche size and duration with related exponents. Previous works have demonstrated this in neural activity, and it is thought that long-range correlations across space and time maximize information processing. Alternatively, temporal and spatial correlation in neural population data can be characterized by the power spectrum and eigendecomposition (via PCA). It is well known that neural power spectra often follow a 1/f power law, where power decays as a function of frequency. More recently, it’s been shown that neural population activity resides on a low-dimensional manifold, and that the eigenvalue spectrum also follows a power law.

    Here we investigate the relationship between the eigenvalue and power spectra – decompositions across space and time, respectively – in population spiking recordings and simulated data. We fit power law models to population power spectra and eigenspectra, and compute the correlation between their power law exponents as a function of population subsampling size, to find a subset size at which potential correlations between the exponents may arise. We find that space and time decompositions were correlated for select brain regions (e.g. V1, V2 and hippocampal formation) in some mice and no definitive subset size initiated inter-spectral correlations. In comparison, we simulate independent colored noise “recordings” with varying exponents, and find 1) their eigenvalue spectra spuriously also follow power law distributions, where 2) the decay exponents in time and space are closely related, despite being independently generated processes. This seems to arise naturally as a consequence of correlating any power law distributed processes. This suggests that low-dimensional (typically power law obeying) neural manifolds can arise purely as a result of the temporal statistics of potentially independent neuronal activity, thus calling for more robust measures of neural manifolds and criticality in the brain.

recLmZi9Lmo7y6Wm0,Limits of perception and richness of behaviour: Dissociating implicit and explicit representations of visual ensembles,"All natural scenes contain elements, for example the leaves on a tree, that share visual features such as shape, texture, and colour. How are these ensembles represented in the visual system? During the last decade, studies have suggested that the visual system encodes summary statistics (e.g., mean and variance) of ensembles to save resources and bypass the bottlenecks of attention and working memory. Claims have even been made that representing visual information as summary statistics is what determines the richness and limitations of our conscious experience. In this study we show that such explicit reports severely underestimate the richness of visual representations. In a set of behavioural experiments our observers searched for an odd-one-out target among heterogeneous distractors and their memory of distractor characteristics was tested using explicit or implicit measures. Observers could explicitly distinguish distractor sets with different mean and variance, but not differently shaped probability distributions. In contrast, our implicit assessment revealed the encoding of mean, variance, and even distribution shape. Furthermore, explicit measures had common noise sources that distinguished them from implicit measures. This shows that the visual system does not reduce information about visual features to summary statistics, but instead that explicit decisions about summary statistics are limited, as if they were based on small samples from an otherwise fully encoded probabilistic representation of visual features. This discovery has implications for the understanding of how information is stored in the visual system and how it is accessed for decision making, suggesting that perception for action can be less limited than visual awareness. Our results provide new insights into the nature of representations of visual information and invite speculation about whether different types of information from encoded feature distributions are available to different visual streams in the brain that may serve different functions.

However, little consideration has been paid to whether such efforts truly improve animal welfare or lead to substantive changes in animal behaviour. The study at hand attempts to empirically validate whether providing rats with minor forms of refinements in their home-cage improves their wellbeing as indexed by anxiety-and depression-like behaviour. Rats (n = 12) in the refined condition were housed in cages that contained various refinements and compared to standard housed rats (n = 12) without access to any home-cage refinements. After one month of habituating to home-cage conditions, rats were tested in a battery of well-validated paradigms of anxiety- and depression-like behaviour including the Elevated Plus Maze, Novelty-Induced Suppression of Feeding (NSFT), Shock Probe Burying, and Sucrose Preference Tests (SPT). There were no significant between-group differences in rats’ behavioural profiles save the NSFT and SPT. Here, rats in the refined housing condition demonstrated heightened anxiety- and depression-like behaviour, which contradicted the prediction that refinements would improve behavioural indices of wellbeing. Notably, animals in both housing conditions displayed unusually high levels of anxiety-like behaviours across all behavioural assessments. These findings raise the possibility that the combination of refinements provided and/or other home-cage and colony variables can contribute to heightened stress, anxiety- and depression-like behaviour in laboratory animals. Beyond implications for animal welfare, disruptions to behavioural profiles pose a considerable challenge for neuroscientific researchers employing animal models as a means to study the brain and behaviour. As such, the impact of home-cage refinements on laboratory animals’ well-being and behavioural profiles requires further clarification.

Such single cell models vary in morphological complexity from single compartment to ones that have over 1000 compartments. Computational overheads necessitate the use of reduced order single cells in large model neuronal networks. However, in such cases, it is important that the reduced order models selected retain the key biophysical properties of biological cells.  We had previously hypothesized that in a single neuron, different sets of current modules might be responsible for maintaining neurocomputational properties such as resting potential, sub-threshold oscillations, and spiking behaviors. An approach termed the ‘segregation methods’ was designed using the hypothesis and tested successfully on several single cell models reported in the literature (Alturki et al., 2016).

Here we add to the segregation approach for designing current ‘modules’ by developing a new module to design bursts and other burst-like waveforms. We provide an example of a pyramidal neuron in the CA3 region of the hippocampus which is shown to respond to stimuli with a doublet at the start followed by tonic spiking, a characteristic neural signature. Furthermore, we investigate the functional significance of the doublet by embedding the single cell model into a previously developed hippocampal network model. We find that the doublet is critical for generating theta in the hippocampal model. A long-term goal is to develop a publicly accessible software tool that automates the process of designing a single cell using the segregation approach.

recLuaBy4muXOHRSB,Using reinforcement learning to train biophysically detailed models of visual-motor cortex to play Atari games,"In this work, we built a biophysically detailed spiking neuronal network model and trained it to play the Atari game Pong using a reinforcement learning algorithm. We explicitly modeled visual areas receiving, relaying and encoding visual inputs from the game environment, and motor areas receiving inputs from visual areas and generating motor commands controlling the game. We deployed reward-based learning mechanisms to produce associations between visual and motor neuronal representations. We used compartmental models of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons interconnected via AMPA/NMDA (excitatory) or GABAA (inhibitory) synapses. Synaptic connection strengths were adjusted to reliably transmit information across visual areas. The neurons in the early visual area received topological inputs and relayed information across all subsequent visual areas in a topological manner encoding object location in the environment. Modeled direction selective neurons were driven by the direction of objects’ motion at their respective locations. In our motor cortex model, neurons associated with a particular motor action were grouped together and received inputs from all visual areas representing the dorsal pathway. For the game Pong, we used three populations of motor neurons, for generating move up, move down and stay commands. Synapses between visual and motor cortex were plastic, so that the connection strengths could be increased or decreased via reinforcement learning. Model-generated actions updated the environment and triggered reward or punishment signals.

recLzlfTVr4AFEmEI,Principles of cortical circuit organization,"In an age of big data, we get inundated with petabytes of information about structure and activity in neural tissues. While large datasets are useful and likely necessary steps towards understanding of the relations between structure, activity and computations in neural tissues, an argument can be made that they are not sufficient. An essential step is to extract a low dimensional description of the data, or principles of its organization. The presentation will focus on one such example, the mesoscopic organization of the cortico-thalamic system in mice. 
 
We have analyzed the Allen Institute Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, a large-scale database of connection in the mouse brain based on anterograde anatomical tracers. We have constructed a model characterizing the connection strength between individual voxels.
 
However, the most interesting observations occur when we go beyond characterizing connections based on strength alone. The essential concept is the addition of connection types. Based on layer distribution of axonal termination patterns in the cortex we characterize nine types of cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical patterns. We have mathematically defined and characterized this organization. These types of connections are not random: they have a statistically significant hierarchical organization. Comparative analysis to functional data shows that this structural organization is well mapped to functional organization. 
 
Cell types and connection types are a ubiquitous observation in biological neural networks, but they are not common in theoretical models of organization of neural circuits, which at large scale use graph theory. I will conclude the talk with an argument for the necessity of introducing cell types in theories of computations, and discuss how this could be achieved (e.g. generalizing concepts from graph theory to multigraph theory).

recM0didjleYKIYxQ,A Quantification of Dendritic and dendritic spine morphology in Cyclooxygenase - 2 – Knockin Mice  ,"Background: ProstaglandinE2 (PGE2) is a lipid signaling molecule involved in normal neurodevelopment. Abnormal PGE2 signalling due to genetic or environmental causes has been linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Previously our lab demonstrated that disrupting the function of COX2, the rate-limiting enzyme of PGE2 production affects the expression of developmental genes important in synaptic transmission and dendritic spine formation in males. Further, Ptgs2 Y385F knockin (COX2-KI) animals demonstrate autism-like behaviours, including impairments in social interaction and motor strength, and repetitive and anxious behaviors. Our Objective was to examine the effect of abnormal PGE2 signalling on the morphology of cerebellar dendritic spines. 
Methods: We examined GOLGI-COX stained cerebellums of COX2-KI and Wild-type B6.129S6(FVB)-Ptgs2tm1.1Fun/J (WT) mice at postnatal day 25 (PN25). We measured dendrite length, branching, and thickness, the proportion of dendrites forming axonal loops, and dendritic spine density and morphology. Measurements were compared between and within conditions (COX2-KI and WT) and sex. 
Results: COX2-KI mice had greater dendritic arborization within 40µm of the soma than WT mice.  Dendrite thickness was greater in WT Females than WT Males. In contrast COX2-KI Males had thicker dendrites than COX2-KI Females. Compared to WT mice, the odds of observing axonal loops was higher in COX2-KI mice. While dendritic spine density was greater in WT Males compared to WT Females, there was no significant difference between COX2-KI Males and Females. Examining dendritic spine morphology, WT Males were less likely to have immature (stubby and filopodia) spine shapes compared to mature (mushroom) shapes, whereas WT females were more likely to have immature (stubby and thin) shapes. Showing the opposite trend, COX2-KI Males and Females were more likely to have immature (stubby and thin) shapes, and mature (mushroom) shapes respectively.  These findings show that PGE2 signalling disruptions in the COX2-KI result in sex-dependent abnormalities in cerebellar neuronal development.

recM140lX6SHdAo0z,Distinct prefrontal top-down circuits differentially modulate sensorimotor behavior,"Sensorimotor behaviors require processing of behaviorally relevant sensory cues and the ability to select appropriate responses from a vast behavioral repertoire. Modulation by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to be key for both processes, but the precise role of specific circuits remains unclear. We examined the sensorimotor function of anatomically distinct outputs from a subdivision of the mouse PFC, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Using a visually guided two-choice behavioral paradigm with multiple cue-response mappings, we dissociated the sensory and motor response components of sensorimotor control. Projection-specific two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulations show that ACC outputs to the superior colliculus, a key midbrain structure for response selection, principally coordinate specific motor responses. Importantly, ACC outputs exert control by reducing the innate response bias of the superior colliculus. In contrast, ACC outputs to the visual cortex facilitate sensory processing of visual cues. Our results ascribe motor and sensory roles to ACC projections to the superior colliculus and the visual cortex and demonstrate a circuit motif for PFC function wherein anatomically non-overlapping output pathways coordinate complementary but distinct aspects of visual sensorimotor behavior.

recMBiAdPxMK0bXT8,Investigating memory accuracy and diversity of generative replay in a predictive coding neural network,"Human memory replay is crucial for memory consolidation and knowledge integration. Similarly, replay can be deployed in an artificial neural network (ANN) to overcome the catastrophic forgetting problem in continual learning. For decades, experience replay (ER) has been applied; an ANN revisits exact old episodes whenever learning a new one. However, ER is not biologically plausible, because it requires an external memory storage with an increasing capacity to stock all old episodes (Kali and Dayan, 2004, Nat. Neurosci.). More recently, generative replay (GR) has been proposed for ANNs capable of predictive coding (PC). When such an ANN learns a new episode, it is simultaneously trained with self-generated samples. Despite the efficiency and the biological plausibility of GR, we were concerned about its effectiveness and robustness, and we investigated the quality of GR in restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), typically trained by contrastive divergence, a PC-like algorithm. We found the replay quality poor in terms of both accuracy and diversity. The individual replays were unidentifiable as any learned episodes by basic similarity measurements. Assorting them by Bayesian classifiers, we found stronger memories were replayed more frequently than weaker ones. Surprisingly, we still managed to replicate the success of an RBM’s continual learning by GR (Mocanu et al., 2016, ArXiv). Our results agree with the claim by van de Ven et al. (2020, Nat. Commun.) that replays with low quality is good enough for preserving past memory traces. We further considered a scenario of GR with relatively small numbers of replays. We found that an RBM could not guarantee all past memories to be replayed even once when learning a new episode, which tended to cause catastrophic forgetting of weaker memories. We argue that the amount of replay is a major constraint of the memory capacity for an ANN in continual learning.",Yihe Lu (Yee-Hur),"Tamás Földes, Cardiff University; Penelope Lewis, Cardiff University",Cardiff University (grid.5600.3),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-30 13:00:00+00:00,2020-10-30 13:15:00+00:00,
recMHgzStnIGSUhwc,Spying on histamine dynamics by development of genetically encoded GRAB sensors,"Histamine is an important biogenic monoamine, involved in many crucial physiological processes, including immune responses, sleep & awake regulation and cognitive function in the brain. In the central nervous system, histamine is mainly released from histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus, acting on a number of brain regions to execute its function. Despite of undisputable function of histaminergic transmission, how histamine release is regulated in the brain is poorly understood, in part due to lacking of sensitive methods to monitor the dynamics of histamine non-invasively with good cell specificity and high spatial-temporal resolution, especially in vivo. Here, we developed genetically-encoded histamine sensors by tapping into cpEGFP and histamine GPCR receptors[1]. We screened different histamine GPCRs and used structure-guided semi-rational screen to yield a histamine biosensor with ΔF/F around 400%. We named this sensor GPCR-Activation-Based sensor for histamine, or GRABHA for short. Now, we are in the developing GRABHA with different affinities and different color spectrum. This histamine sensor tool would likely enhance our understanding of complex histaminergic neuromodulation in vivo in both physiological and pathological conditions.

recMIwXafKU4cAmfw,Regression-based EEG analysis reveals temporally scaled signals during interval timing,"The ability to act and perceive over different timescales is critical in our lives, yet the neural basis of flexible timing remains poorly understood. Recently animal work suggests that flexible timing is achieved via temporal scaling within medial frontal cortex, where a common neuronal response is stretched or compressed across the length of the produced interval. Our goal was to determine whether such scaling could be found non-invasively at the scalp using electroencephalography (EEG). A traditional EEG analysis can only capture fixed-time components because it assumes that neural activity occurs at fixed-time latencies. To capture scaled-time activity, we developed a regression-based approach to unmix fixed-time and scaled-time components within the EEG. After validating the approach using simulated data, we conducted two interval timing experiments. In one task, human participants learned to produce either a short, medium, or long interval. In a second task, they judged the accuracy of a computer-produced interval. In both tasks, we observed a scaled-time component that was distinct from the preceding and following fixed-time components. Interestingly, the earlier in time that the scaled-time component peaked, the faster the participant responded. These results suggest that temporal scaling is a feature of human interval timing and may provide a general method for recovering temporally scaled signals associated with other cognitive processes known to unfold over varying timescales.",Cameron Hassall (he/him),"Jack Harley, University of Oxford; Nils Kolling, University of Oxford; Laurence Hunt, University of Oxford",University of Oxford (grid.4991.5),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 11:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 11:15:00+00:00,

Objective: The aim of this systematic review/meta-analysis was to appraise and summarize the literature about magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) outcomes in people with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) to identify the altered brain structure and function compared to healthy controls (HC).
Background: CTS represents the most common nerve entrapment neuropathy in the arm associated with an altered nociceptive system peripherally and centrally. 
Methods: Two reviewers screened studies for eligibility by title and abstract then by reading the full text. This systematic review/meta-analysis used PRISMA guidelines to report the outcomes. Five databases were searched for relevant literature (Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane). Studies comparing  MRI and fMRI findings in people with chronic CTS (present for at least 3 months) and HC through the following  parameters: 1) Interdigit cortical representation distance, 2) cluster size of digit representation on somatosensory cortex. Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale was used for risk of bias assessment. When possible, the results from different studies were pooled and meta-analysis was done using standardized mean difference (SMD) as effect size measures based on random effect model. 
Results: There was a significant reduction of interdigit cortical separation distance of index-middle and index-little fingers in the CTS (SMD=-0.878, 95%CI (-1.27, -0.48), P-value=0.00) and  (SMD=-0.84, 95%CI (-1.26, -0.42), P-value=0.00) respectively. Moreover, middle-little fingers interdigit separation showed no significant difference. 
Conclusion: In CTS, cluster size of index, middle and little fingers representation in the primary somatosensory cortex showed significant blurring as evident by increased their cluster size as well as reduction of interdigit cortical separation distance between both index-middle and index-little fingers. Altered cortical morphology and function proved the central mechanisms might be involved in CTS providing a base for future treatment strategies.

Chronic pain is commonly experienced with MS, and changes in the kappa opioid system have been described in several models of chronic pain. This project aims to characterize changes in kappa opioid receptor (KOR) analgesia and expression in a mouse model of MS.

	To accomplish this, male and female C57Bl/6 mice were induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which models the inflammation, autoimmunity, and demyelination that occurs in human MS. At the first sign of disease presentation, systemic injection of KOR agonist U50,488H (1.6 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) evoked equipotent analgesic responses in EAE and control mice. However, local administration of U50,488H into the spinal cord (10 ug, i.t.) was significantly less analgesic in EAE mice. To explore this disparity, KOR mRNA and protein expression was measured in various CNS regions associated with pain using fluorescent in situ hybridization and western blot, respectively. In the spinal cord, KOR mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in EAE mice. No changes were detected in KOR protein levels in the amygdala and the claustrum; however, there was a significant increase in the expression of KOR protein in the nucleus accumbens of EAE mice.

	Overall, this data suggests that systemic KOR agonism is effective at eliciting analgesia in a mouse model of MS. We posit that reductions in KOR expression in the spinal cord are compensated by increases in supraspinal KOR expression to maintain analgesic potential, especially in the nucleus accumbens.",Caylin Chadwick,"Caylin I.

recMiCwmRZ5ePbzSp,Patterning of corpus callosum integrity in glioma observed by MRI: Effect of 2D bi-axial lamellar brain architecture,"Abstract
Purpose
Corpus callosum (CC) is a main channel histologically for glioma spreading, downgrading the prognosis, the infiltration occurring through cellular reaction–diffusion process. Preliminary clinical trial indicates that CC’s surgical interruption appreciably enhances clinical outcome. We aim to find how high-grade glioma phenomenology is reflected in CC parameters, including various 3D diffusion eigenvalues differentially, whereby this information may be utilized for planning radiotherapy and surgical intervention.

Methods
Using 3 Tesla MRI diffusion-tensor imaging of glioma patients and matched controls, we formulated the callosal volume, fibre count, and 3D directional diffusivity eigenvalues (λ1–λ2–λ3), utilizing FDT/FMRIB-based analysis.

Results
In glioma, the callosal volume, fibre count and normalized volume decreases (p < 0.001), while axial diffusivity λ1 and radial diffusivity component λ2 significantly increase (p = 0.03, p = 0.04). Though not expected, the other radial diffusivity component λ3 remains unchanged (p = 0.11). Increase of λ1 and λ2 is due to gliomatous migration across the two directions (eigenvectors of λ1, λ2), which correlate respectively with medio-lateral commissural fibres and dorso-ventral perforating fibres in CC. These are corroborated by collateral radiological findings and immunohistological staining of those two fibre-systems in cat and human.

Conclusion
In glioma, the two diffusivities (λ1, λ2), enhance due to fluidic edema permeation through CC’s bi-axial lamina-type structural scaffold, formed by mediolateral commissural fibres and dorsoventral perforating cingulo-septal fibres. On other hand, the two radial diffusivities (λ2, λ3) are physiologically different and can be distinguished as lamellar diffusivity and focal diffusivity respectively.

Early diagnosis of autism disorder involves in-depth behavioral observation and testing, which can be time consuming, expensive, and affected by clinician diagnostic bias. Early diagnosis of ASD using non-behavioral measurements can lead to improved outcomes for children with ASD. We developed algorithms to classify ASD based on publicly available brain-imaging datasets (ABIDE), including brain scans from people with and without ASD diagnosis. Using a multilayer perceptron neural network, we classified preprocessed data from 200 regions of interest (atlas of craddock 200) into binary categories of ASD positive or negative. To overcome overfitting of the training dataset, we used a novel approach to determine the most relevant subset of the preprocessed data. This led to a significant increase in our held-out testing accuracy. Our results indicate that brain imaging data alone, without any behavioral assessments, can be used to classify ASD diagnosis using dimensionality reduction and machine learning techniques.

recN0NhTFjQgVRNiL,Within and across domain effects of choice-induced bias,"Recent evidence suggests choices influence evaluation, giving rise to choice-induced confirmation bias. It is however unknown whether this phenomenon is constrained to the domain of choice, or spans across domains, allowing a decision to influence evaluation of unrelated item-specific information. 
Here, we intermix value-based and perceptual choices and evaluations of a set of appetitive stimuli to study both within and across domain effects of choices on value estimation. In a set of 5 experiments (4 preregistered, total of 425 participants) we find strong and consistent evidence for both within and across domain effects of choice induced bias in both domains. This means perceptual choices influenced subjective appetitive value, and value-based choices influenced perceived size.
The effect is stronger for value-based estimations, and for domain-congruent choices. The bias is driven to a greater extent by devaluing rejected items, is specific to endogenous (self-generated) choices, and cannot be explained by positive evidence bias. Our generative model of choice-driven value fluctuation reveals that only within-domain effects are long lasting. 
These findings reveal that the act of free choice influences the estimation of  both choice-relevant and irrelevant attributes of the chosen item, providing further insight into how choices shape internal values.

Although innate, these defensive behaviors show a remarkable amount of flexibility and are subject to robust habituation, suggesting that the circuitry underlying defensive behaviors is subject to modulatory control. Using a combination of viral tracing and slice electrophysiology, we show that the cerebellum may provide one source of afferent modulatory influence within the periaqueductal gray by preferentially synapsing onto local dopaminergic neurons within the vlPAG. In turn, vlPAG dopamine neurons altered the relative strength of synaptically evoked inhibition and excitation onto transgenically identified freezing premotor neurons in the vlPAG. More specifically, activation of postsynaptic D2 receptors increased the strength of inhibition and decreased the strength of excitation. Such modulation is predicted to increase spike threshold and alter the gain of the input-output relationship, thereby changing the integrative properties of freezing premotor neurons. Together, these results suggest that locally released dopamine within the vlPAG modulates synaptic integration in freezing related neurons, which is controlled, at least in part, by input from the cerebellum.

As per WHO and DSM-V, it is a severe chronic mental disorder characterized by aggravations in thought, recognition, and behavior. Different reports present its causes,symptoms, medications, particularly its pathways and neurotransmitters' involvement. Studying several papers, we can see that the most tedious step is to examine all the pathways, and their adjusted or changed pathways in the wake of consuming the endorsed medications. Changes in the neurotransmitters' synapse with or without the administration ofdrugs are still under observation. The interconnections of various pathways like dopamine, serotonin, and GABA is in the measure. In this study, we aim to present a novel perspective by identifying some new pathways, which are changed due to various chemicals on neurotransmitters. We have studied multiple articles from all the directions, and in this paper, we reveal the potential causes and symptoms of the disorder, the role of neurotransmitters, and various brain pathways. The pathways of synapses like dopamine, serotonin, and GABA across multiplebrain locales before and after consuming medications are also discussed.Additionally, we have examined similar brain areas for healthy human subjectsand discovered some strong confirmations that the areas such as prefrontal cortex, limbic hippocampus, and ventral tegmental zone are the brain's most affected regions schizophrenia.We hypothesize that there may be unfamiliar pathways in these areas, as other than dopamine, there are similar synapses like serotonin and GABA, present in these areas. Along thisway,this understanding of schizophrenia may mark a novel path for some further investigations of such unfamiliar pathways.

Direct pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs) expressing dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) project monosynaptically to the substantia nigra (SNr) to promote movement while indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) expressing D2R project monosynaptically to the globus pallidus externus (GPe) to oppose movement. Recent functional studies, however, reveal that during native movements both pathways are activated. Moreover, anatomical and physiological studies have put into question the organization of the basal ganglia. For instance, we and others have shown that a large fraction of dSPNs possess axon collaterals within the GPe. These “bridging” collaterals are plastic in the adult animal and regulated by D2Rs and neuronal activity. These findings, though indirect, suggested an important role of dSPN bridging collaterals in regulating the balance of the direct and indirect pathway and motor function. Here, we used a combination of genetic targeting, calcium in vivo imaging, dSPN terminal-specific manipulations and behavioral tracking (DeepLabCut) to determine the role of dSPN bridging collaterals in motor function. We found that dSPN bridging collaterals were activated during specific movements in the rotarod. dSPN terminal inhibition also decreased locomotion and impaired rotarod performance. Recent physiology work shows that dSPNs preferentially target the non-canonical, striatal-backprojecting, arkypallidal Npas1 neurons in the GPe. We here found that stimulation of dSPNs inhibited Npas1 neurons in awake behaving mice. Finally, we found that Npas1 stimulation recapitulated the effects of dSPN inhibition by decreasing locomotion and rotarod function. We propose a model by which dSPN bridging collaterals support movement via inhibition of Npas1 neurons in the GPe. Thus, direct pathway GPe terminals act in concert with the canonical terminals in the SNr by inhibiting a potential stop signal going back to the striatum.",Marie Labouesse,"Marie A.

recNGjFOGZnY7rEBr,Cognitive Impairment and Rehabilitation in Alzheimer’s Disease,"A wealth of evidence emphasizes on the link between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive impairment (CI). CI is generally accepted as a decline in memory, learning capacity, concentration, or decision-making, leading to functional impairment. The role of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as a predictive factor of AD and the CI linked to the establishment and progression of AD have been discussed in the context of epidemiology, genetics, pathophysiology, pathology, and clinical practice. AD-associated CI has been also addressed as a source of socioeconomic burden urging for the development of therapeutic interventions. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a complementary non-pharmaceutical treatment for AD consisting of cognitive stimulation and training methods. Based on the neuronal plasticity concept, CR aims at increasing AD patients’ functional status and retarding their mental decline. Although the method has encouraging results in several studies, there is still controversy as far as its efficacy is concerned and further research ought to be conducted before incorporating CR in AD’s treatment plan globally. CR drawbacks should be addressed and counteracted in this context, while the current CR approach may be ameliorated through errorless learning techniques.",Dorothy Martha Scordilis,"Theodoros Angelopoulos, Dorothy Martha Scordilis, Christos Tsagkaris",Medical University of Sofia,"Theme A: Development, Neurodegenerative Disorders and Injury",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 13:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 13:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/2vNhGCKnT9M
recNHCFcx6Uzzz2zd,Neural processes underlying contextual influences on decisions,"Our everyday social interactions affect not only our own decision making process and actions, but also the spread and evolution of information. As social interactions become increasingly online through social media, information consumed through this medium shapes how we think. We examined the neural underpinnings guiding the impact of information and context (e.g., social vs cyber) on decision making, where information credibility varies greatly. In this study, 240 healthy participants answered a questionnaire surrounding a variety of current issues (e.g., vaccinations, capital punishment, etc.) at three points in the study: (1) before interacting with a simulated social media environment that presented news articles including real and fake information, (2) following the social media platform interaction, and (3) after talking to other participants in a group. Electroencephalography (EEG) was measured during interactions with the social media platform. Participants were then scored based on how much they changed their opinion and categorized as “cyber influenced”, “socially influenced”, both, or neither, in order to evaluate the hypothesis that variability in opinions is linked to variability in neural behavior. Neural variability was analyzed using two methods: (1) traditional power analysis and (2) connectivity strength using a network approach that measures statistical relationships among nodes (EEG electrodes). Results show the respective neural pathways of information processing via digital interaction and in-person social interaction were not statistically different, suggesting that similar neural processes may serve both types of decisions to change their opinion, regardless of context. We further investigated this finding using more sensitive approaches to aggregate network changes, differentiating individuals that are more susceptible to information presented through a social media platform. Our results suggest different scales of neural processing underlying decision making are at play when individuals are presented with a variety of reliable and unreliable information in different contexts.

recNMaacfSkH27HJu,Role of interneurons in populations’ neural coding and network properties in auditory cortex,"Cortical neuronal networks are comprised of multiple types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which
perform specific computations. In the auditory cortex (AC), excitatory neurons receive the sound input and
transmit the processed signal to other areas, whereas the inhibitory neurons dynamically help shape the
response of the excitatory neurons. In the last decade, we have learned specific functions of distinct
inhibitory neurons, yet how different interneuron subpopulations affect network dynamics remains
unexplored. To establish the role of different interneuron subpopulations within the cortical network, we
stimulated specific interneuron subpopulations, while imaging the network responses to sounds in the AC.
We monitored the activity of populations of hundreds of neurons using two-photon calcium imaging and
simultaneously increased the activity of a subpopulation of interneurons using optogenetic stimulation. We
focused on VIP and SOM inhibitory neurons, which have previously been found to shape cortical responses
in a context-dependent fashion (Natan et al, 2015; Pi et al, 2013). Response of neurons activated by sound
were enhanced when VIPs were activated but reduced upon activation of SOMs. Using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization, we identify subgraphs of neurons with increased connectivity when the activity of VIP or SOM interneurons is increased and describe their network properties. Our results suggest that the differential role of inhibitory neuron types on cortical activity extends from affecting not just single neuron responses, but also cortical function at the network level.",Melanie Tobin (she/her),"M.

recNNnZSMBKb2xaST,Decoding explicit and implicit representations of food health and taste attributes in the human brain ,"Visual food cues are constantly encountered in everyday life and are closely related to dietary decisions. The processing of these cues involves two key attributes: taste and health. This study aimed to examine whether and when these attributes are represented in the brain during the viewing of food images a) while making explicit health/taste judgements, and b) while implicitly considering food attributes for consumption decisions. We used multivariate support vector regression to determine whether spatiotemporal patterns of event-related potentials occurring in the first 1200 ms after the presentation of a food image could predict ratings of tastiness and healthiness on a trial-by-trial basis. In Experiment 1, participants (N = 37) were directly instructed to rate the tastiness and healthiness of various food items. The results showed that taste and health ratings could both be predicted significantly above chance, with taste (530-640 ms, 680-770 ms, 820-980 ms) becoming decodable slightly earlier than health (640-710 ms). In Experiment 2, a different sample of participants (N = 89) rated how strongly they would like to consume various food items, with no explicit instruction to consider tastiness or healthiness. Using the same analysis approach, we found that taste (740-1190 ms) and health (530-830ms) ratings could again be predicted significantly above chance. We could also predict the decision strength (830-920 ms), which might reflect the integration of taste and health information for decision-making. Taken together, our results suggest that taste and health information is decodable from electroencephalography data during dietary decisions, even when participants are not explicitly instructed to consider these attributes. This finding provides an exciting path for future studies to investigate potential alterations of taste and health representations following interventions, such as health warning messages, aimed at improving dietary choices.",Elektra Schubert,"Elektra Schubert, University of Melbourne; Daniel Rosenblatt, University of Melbourne; Djamila Eliby, University of Melbourne; Yoshihisa Kashima, University of Melbourne; Hinze Hogendoorn, University of Melbourne; Stefan Bode, University of Melbourne",University of Melbourne (grid.1008.9),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-28 01:30:00+00:00,2020-10-28 01:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/FTzwQ9zYbSg
recNbArBpRa9T8cpn,Playing magic tricks to deep neural networks untangles human deception,"Magicians have been in the business of hacking people’s minds for centuries. Some cognitive scientists, mainly those interested in attention and perception, have tried to explain why and how magic works, usually in laboratory conditions and using conventional psychophysical techniques and wisdom. Here we take a step in the opposite direction and ask not what neuroscience can do for magic but what magic can do for neuroscience in order to better understand human cognition. To that end, we studied the sleights of hand of a professional magician in the real world, upon several tricks where coins appear, disappear, multiply, and translocate. Using DeepLabCut, an AI-based pose-estimation system, we measured precisely the motor skills of the magician. We also trained the deep neural network to follow the coins, even when they were not visible. In other words, we transformed a tracking neural network into an artificial spectator. Can we fool it? Given that the neural network was trained by a human, what does it absorb and reflect about our own cognitive biases? The algorithm itself is indifferent to the speed of the magician’s performance and unaffected by change or inattentional blindness. However, just like a human spectator, the machine might still wrongly assume that a coin is in a closed fist, be uncertain, or even get “confused” when discovering it is not there. Overall, we find that the network possesses but also lacks some of the key human brain priors that grant illusionism its effectiveness. Our approach thus shows how it might be possible to use magic techniques to target the development of adversarial cognitive tricks at humans by choosing AI models that match human cognition as closely as possible. We can learn from what machines learn from us, creating a new powerful mirror to look into ourselves. ",Regina Zaghi,Miguel Ángel Gea; Jordi Camí; Luis M.

recNc7Bs57SP1sY1x,Auditory Corticothalamic Neurons are Recruited by Motor Preparatory Inputs ,"During active sensing, neural responses to sensory inputs directly generated by our own movements are suppressed. In the auditory cortex (ACtx), self-initiated movements elicit corollary discharge from secondary motor cortex (M2) that suppresses pyramidal neuron (PyrN) spiking via recruitment of local inhibitory neurons. Using single unit electrophysiology, we observed that ACtx layer (L)6 PyrNs were also activated hundreds of milliseconds prior to movement onset, at approximately the same time as fast spiking inhibitory neurons. Most L6 PyrNs were corticothalamic (CT) cells, which all expressed FoxP2, a protein marker enriched in brain areas that integrate sensory inputs to control vocal motor behaviors. Using a combination of two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetically targeted single unit recordings, we found that L6 CTs were strongly activated prior to orofacial movements, but not locomotion. The specific recruitment by facial movements suggests that L6 CTs may receive a different source of motor input, beyond M2. Monosynaptic rabies tracing revealed that L6 CTs received ten times more direct inputs from the basal ganglia than M2. 
Our prior work found that optogenetic activation of L6 CTs reset the phase of low-frequency ACtx oscillations, modified sensory tuning in the thalamus and cortex, and switched perception into modes of enhanced detection or enhanced discrimination. Here, we show that preparatory facial movements can act like an optogenetic pulse, possibly priming cortical circuits for vocal feedback monitoring. These findings identify new pathways and local circuits for motor modulation of sound processing and suggest a new role for CT neurons in active sensing.

recNgDGT7NJqNrKky,Preparatory eye movements reveal prior knowledge and intended interaction in VR,"Most studies on human cognitive behavior are performed in controlled laboratory settings, limiting the validity and understanding of cognition in more naturalistic settings. The study of eye-movements in naturalistic tasks has revealed that the eyes precede the hands during an action. However, it is unclear how anticipatory and task-oriented eye movements are affected by prior knowledge about objects. The present study aims to investigate eye movement behavior while interacting with familiar and unfamiliar objects in a virtual environment. 
In this experiment, we study the gaze dynamics during interaction with 12 three-dimensional tool models in a virtual environment. We introduce a 2x2x2 factorial design with factors task, familiarity, and orientation. Participants were instructed to either lift or use a given familiar or unfamiliar tool. We presented the tools in two different orientations where the tool handle was presented either on the left or right side.
We used linear mixed models, with a random slope and intercept for subject and stimulus items, to model the odds of fixations on the tool effector before grasp initiation based on task, familiarity, and orientation. The results suggest that subjects fixate more on the tool effector when the tool is unfamiliar and during the use task.  Also, during the lift task, fixations on the tool effector and handle were equally likely. Additionally, we did not find any effect of the orientation of the tool. 
These findings suggest that the given task and the available knowledge about an object influence a person’s gaze control strategy during object interaction. Finally, the effect of prior knowledge and task type in a naturalistic setting lends further evidence towards eye movements predominantly driven by higher-level cognitive functions.

recNhyHp3puLoi0rN,Sensory versus culturally shaped expectations in the neural processing of music,"When listening to music, we constantly attempt to predict the sounds that will follow. For example, quite often we end up humming, singing along or tapping our foot to the beat, and find pleasure in listening to pieces we know very well. However, the nature and brain basis of musical predictions or expectations remain poorly understood. Concretely, we do not know the extent to which these expectations arise from adaptation to the sensory properties of sounds or from a more cognitive and culturally shaped learning of the statistics of musical pieces and styles. In this presentation, I will address this issue by showing MEG data and modeling work in which the neural correlates of melodic expectations are investigated. I will show comparisons between the performance of a cognitive model of music statistical learning (IDyOM) and simpler metrics of acoustic similarity between tones (e.g. pitch distance, cosine similarity) in predicting neural responses to sounds. For this, an encoding model based on regularized linear regression was used. Preliminary results show that, across listening conditions, datasets and types of listeners, acoustic similarity models outperform cognitive models, thus suggesting a prominent role of sensory expectations in shaping neural responses to musical sounds. Potential neuronal mechanisms will be discussed, as well as the relationship of our findings with behavioral studies suggesting a preponderance of cognitive over sensory expectations during music listening.",David R.

The versatility of microglia has long been attributed to heterogeneity. Recent studies revealed possible heterogeneity in human but not murine microglia, yet a firm demonstration linking microglial heterogeneity to functional phenotypes remains scarce. Here, we identified two distinct microglial populations in adult zebrafish that differ in morphology, distribution, development, and function. The predominant population – phagocytotic microglia, which expresses ccl34b.1, is broadly distributed, amoeboid in shape, highly mobile and phagocytotic. The other white matter-enriched ccl34b.1- population, termed regulatory microglia, possesses ramified protrusions but has limited mobility and phagocytosis capability. Their functional differences are further supported by distinct transcriptomes and responses to bacterial infection, where ccl34b.1+ microglia function in tissue clearance and ccl34b.1- microglia release immune regulators.

recOFY9t6TqJyTcQV,Transforming Sensory Cues into Aversive Emotion via Septal-Habenular Pathway,"Emotions evoked by environmental cues are important for animal survival and life quality. However, neural circuits responsible for transforming sensory signals to aversive emotion and behavioral avoidance remain unclear. Here, we found that medial septum (MS) mediates aversion induced by both auditory and somatosensory stimuli. Ablation of glutamatergic or GABAergic MS neurons results in impaired or strengthened aversion, respectively. Optogenetic activation of the two cell types results in place avoidance and preference, respectively. Cell-type-specific screening reveals that glutamatergic MS projections to the lateral habenula (LHb) are responsible for the induction of aversion, which can be antagonized by GABAergic MS projections to LHb. Additionally, the sensory-induced place avoidance is facilitated by enhanced locomotion mediated by glutamatergic MS projections to the preoptic area. Thus, MS can transmit innately aversive signals via a bottom-up multimodal sensory pathway and produce concurrent emotional and motional effects, allowing animals to efficiently avoid unfavorable environments. Zhang et al. reveal a circuit for processing innately aversive sensory signals, with glutamatergic projections from MS to LHb and POA to generate the emotional and a motional effect, respectively.

The selectivity of single neurons for the same stimulus dimension often changes depending on its context, a phenomenon known as nonlinear mixed selectivity (NMS).  It has previously been hypothesized that nonlinear mixed selectivity (NMS) emerges as a result of training in Working Memory (WM). In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining neuronal responses at different PFC areas, before and after monkeys were trained to perform different WM tasks involving visual stimuli location and/or shapes. We found that training induces a modest increase in the proportion of neurons with NMS only for spatial, but not shape feature working memory task, with area 9/46 undergoing the most significant change in NMS cell proportion. Furthermore, we also found that higher working memory task complexity, in the form of requiring to remember location and shape combinations, does not increase the degree of nonlinear mixed selectivity for stimulus shape with other task variables. Lastly, in contrast to previous finding, we saw little evidence that NMS is predictive of task performance.

My interest in the lyre was enhanced upon learning of the “healing” properties” of David’s lyre as presented in the Old Testament. A new window opens and the concept of art serving a function betony mere enjoyment becomes as magical as the mythology itself. “Dancing with Parkinson’s” expands the participants perception of music and dance within the studio and occurs in more than 25 countries all over the world. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological disorder with no known cure and no disease modifying treatments. The rising tide of 60,000 Americans with PD per year presents a huge challenge for society for affected individuals, medical professional and care givers. The disease demands intense patient care while negatively impacting quality of life on all those involved. Our group conducts research on the impact of dance upon individuals diagnosed with PD since 2013 (Bearss, Desouza, 2017). Weekly dance classes for people with PD, a dance choreographer, and a pianist have been occurring for seven years. We sample all people’s data through multimodal brain imaging scans, behaviour analysis, clinical tests and self-reported questionnaires. Results indicate promising positive effects of participating in dance (Bearss et al 2017; DeSouza and Bearss, 2018; Ciantar et al 2019). The Covid-19 Pandemic diminished the possibility of continuing the classes although the program administrators tried to maintain the spirit of this long running program via online sessions. No additional tests can be run on studying the effects of virtual dance classes on the participants’ brains but collecting data through online questionnaires can help studying the correlation between on-line dancing and telehealth. The desire of patients for continuing the online delivery is a definite sign of some benefits.

recOQpUzpVxGZkQpJ,Neural dynamics underlying the coding of location and running speed in the medial entorhinal cortex,"Memory-guided navigation and path integration require accurate coding of location and running speed. In mammals, path integration relies on memory circuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), where grid cells are proposed to provide a metric for space. The linear and positive modulation of firing rates observed in MEC speed cells has been proposed to provide a running speed signal for updating grid cell firing and supporting path integration.
In the first part of my talk, I will demonstrate that rate coding of running speed by speed cells in the MEC differs across time scales and works best at seconds-long time scales. I will further present data that such a slow and linear rate code is insufficient for accurate real-time coding of running speed as required by current computational models of grid cell firing and path integration.
Spatially periodic grid cell firing in the MEC relies on inputs from the medial septum. The second part of my talk will examine the role of medial septum inputs for theta oscillatory activity and speed cell firing in the MEC. 
The last part of my talk will examine the time course of changes in spatiotemporal accuracy of grid cell firing after transitions between light and dark conditions. Data will show that slow changes in grid cell stability on a time scale of tens of seconds are accompanied by slow changes in the local field potential theta frequency vs. running speed relationship, a proposed oscillatory speed signal. Furthermore, darkness results in large changes in the firing rates of many neurons including speed cells that explain the observed changes in the slopes of speed tuning curves.

recOTXvSyJpSfwbqW,Investigating spatial specificity in the interaction between working memory and visual perception,"Content in visual working memory has been shown to impact ongoing visual processing in a stimulus-specific manner, suggesting a common neural substrate supporting both visual perception and working memory maintenance. However, it remains unclear whether working memory for visual features retains a representation of its spatial location at encoding or whether the representation of the feature is abstracted away from the spatial context in which it is encountered. The current study investigated whether spatial location modulates working memory’s interaction with perception through a set of three psychophysical experiments. In Experiment 1, subjects performed a perceptual discrimination of orientation while concurrently holding an orientation in working memory. Memory content boosted the perceived contrast of the discriminandum when the two matched in orientation, but only when their location also overlapped. Conversely, memory precision declined when the location of memorandum and discriminandum mismatched, suggesting that location mismatch might disrupt context binding in working memory. To ensure that this observed effect reflects low-level perceptual interaction, in Experiment 2 the task demands in the memory and perceptual tasks were set to be entirely orthogonal and thus removing potential decision biases. We found that this location-specificity held in both the contrast perception and the memory report. Finally, Experiment 3 tested whether context-binding demand influences the spatial extent of this interaction. We introduced a condition that discouraged the binding of feature and location by shifting the memory probe to a non-matching, central location, and found that working memory content enhanced contrast perception of the discriminandum at both overlapping and non-overlapping positions, suggesting a spatially non-specific effect. Overall, these results demonstrate that, depending on the context-binding demand, working memory of features can be optimized to either retain a representation of its spatial location or not, and highlight the flexible encoding of working memory.",Chunyue Teng,"Brad R.

In neuroscience, the structure of the brain (connectome) can be modeled as a network, where neurons or regions of interest are thought of as nodes, and the connections between these regions are thought of as edges. Through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), one can estimate the presence of “nodes” and “edges”in the brain, thus representing it as a graph. Additional advancements in methodologies involving electron microscopy have allowed for the ability to capture information on individual neurons and synapses. This has made the use of network statistics important in the study of brains. Specifically, the graph matching algorithm (also known as the quadratic assignment problem) seeks to quantify the underlying similarity between two networks, determining an alignment of nodes between them.  This analysis can be utilized to quantify similarities in inter- and intra-species connectomes, or to predict homologous neuron pairs across brain hemispheres.

recOUsmOFwe2UHlMH,Categorical representation by suppression or enhancement of auditory stimuli during perceptual learning,"Perceptual learning reliably enhances cortical representations of task-relevant stimuli in trained animals. However, these neural changes have predominantly been observed outside of behavioral context and regardless of learning rate. Our lab found that engagement in behavior alters auditory cortical responses via local inhibition and cholinergic signaling (Kuchibhotla et al., 2017). Here, we examined how sensory representations in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons change over auditory perceptual learning in mice on a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task. 

We performed simultaneous 2-photon imaging of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in auditory cortex throughout 2AFC auditory conditioning in head-fixed mice. To obtain water reward, animals learned to lick a left lick port for tones of a single, target frequency (11-16 kHz) and right for tones of all other frequencies. Discrimination between target (left) and surround (right) frequencies improved over 9-21 days. While animals were task-engaged, ~50% of stimulus-responsive excitatory neurons exhibited a categorical response, not encoding the frequency of the stimulus, but rather the behavioral choice on that trial. We observed two distinct population-level tuning in experienced animals; animals exhibited either a relative enhancement or suppression of the frequencies reported as target. 

Using chronic two-photon imaging to track neurons longitudinally, we examined when these response profiles emerged during learning. We could detect whether an animal would likely exhibit enhancement or suppression as early as day 6 in behavioral learning. We developed a network model of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to explore what may account for these individual differences and how they arise over learning.

In particular, Zalesky et al. (2010) proposed Network-based Statistics (NBS) a mathematical approach that allows statistical inferences at the (sub-)network level, with a trade-off between false positive control and higher statistical power than mass univariate approaches (e.g. FDR). Nevertheless, NBS is based on general linear hypothesis testing (GLHT) which potentially limits its application to longitudinal samples, particularly, with an unbalanced sample, i.e., with a variable number of sessions per subject. We implemented a publicly available software R package, NBR (Network-Based R-statistics), that performs linear mixed-effects models (LME) in the NBS framework, allowing the exploration of unbalanced longitudinal samples.
We tested GLHT- and LME-NBS in the public dataset INDI-SLIM, which includes 333 participants (145 males; 17-28 y.o.) with two (n=212) or three (n=121) sessions each. All sessions include a resting-state fMRI scan and psychometric data. State anxiety scores and connectivity matrices between brain lobes were extracted. GLHT and LME tested the edgewise brain-behavior relationship for balanced (424 matrices) and unbalanced (787 matrices) samples, respectively.
The LME approach found a significant subnetwork, which includes the cingulum, frontal, parietal, occipital, and cerebellum (pFWE = 0.001), while GLHT found no significant results (pFWE = 0.355).
In summary, we developed an R package that implements LME for NBS. We showed that LME-NBS overpowers GLHT-NBS when dealing with unbalanced longitudinal samples. This is important given that missing data is very common in longitudinal samples, and balanced testing could dramatically undermine statistical power. Hence, considering the growth of longitudinal samples in neuroscience, we anticipate this method being potentially useful in the field.",Zeus Gracia-Tabuenca,"Sarael Alcauter, National Autonomous University of Mexico",National Autonomous University of Mexico (grid.9486.3),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-26 22:00:00+00:00,2020-10-26 22:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/ouFsj_e1-5g

Researchers have suggested that aberrant attentional function to exogenous stimuli contribute substantially to social deficits among individuals with ASD. The attentional function is modulated by locus coeruleus (LC) and its noradrenergic projections throughout the brain, and the LC activity has been shown abnormal among the ASD population. As an index of LC-NA activity, PDR provides a convenient and non-invasive measure for studying attentional deficits. However, previous research has focused on examining PDR when individuals with ASD process social stimuli (e.g., face pictures) or engage in complicated cognitive tasks. Here we used a simple auditory oddball task to test children with ASD and their age-matched typically-developed controls (TD group). Participants were required to listen to the stimuli without task responses while their PDR was continuously monitored. Compared to standard stimuli (pure-tone beeps), deviant stimuli induced phasic PDR in both groups. Social (laughter) and non-social (noise) deviants elicit similar PDR. Importantly, the ASD group exhibited significantly smaller PDR than the TD group. Controlling for age and IQ, we observed a strong negative relationship between PDR and ASD symptom severity across groups and a weak correlation within the ASD group. Our results suggest that aberrant attention function among individuals with ASD is not limited to social stimuli but probably include stimuli without social or affective content. Reduced LC-related responsivity to novel stimuli has important implications for affected attention orientating that has been proposed as a fundamental problem for social development in ASD.

We wanted to explore the latent structure across different cognitive tasks within the human connectome project (HCP) using PCA.
Methods: We applied PCA to task-evoked functional activity. The analytical pipeline was as follows: Time series for each task were extracted from the dataset. Each task was broken down into their separate sub-conditions (e.g., 0-back and 2-back working memory conditions.) Each condition for each task was then decomposed into a functional connectivity matrix. Finally, PCA was applied to each condition across each task. 
Results: PCA components were extracted for each of the tasks in the HCP dataset. Initially, we examined how many components would best characterize the variability across tasks. Some tasks required many components to explain 95% of the variance (e.g., gambling, motor, emotion) whereas others required fewer (working memory, social) Across tasks, four components would be able to explain 95% of the variance. 
Discussion: Our findings reveal that fewer components are needed to explain the variance in complex working memory and social tasks than in seemingly simpler tasks (e.g. motor). This may be due to the added noise of cognitive tasks, leading to a more distributed variance across components. It could also be due to mind-wandering during simpler tasks. In datasets like HCP which incorporate many types of tasks, PCA can be a helpful tool to project the functional connectivity patterns into spaces in which tasks are distinguishable. PCA is also a useful dimensionality reduction tool in fMRI data to reduce the size of the data without losing much of the variance within the dataset.",Nora Bradford (She/her),"Davide Momi, University ""G. d'Annunzio"" of Chieti ; Nora Bradford, University of California, Irvine; Ladan Shahshahani, University of Western Ontario; Corey Richier, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","University of California, Irvine (grid.266093.8)",Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-28 13:00:00+00:00,2020-10-28 13:15:00+00:00,

recPD8OvnZZUzFwz3,Human control of complex objects: Stochastic optimal feedback control and beyond,"For several decades, goal-directed reaching in the horizontal plane has served as testbed to gain insight into human control and adaptation of movements. A prominent model that has successfully accounted for a variety of observations is stochastic optimal feedback control that minimizes muscular effort and kinematic accuracy given signal-dependent noise. This body of research simplified the movement to free pointing tasks, excluding any real-world interactions with objects and the environment. Our research extends the sensorimotor challenge and examines ‘reaching’ while transporting a non-rigid object, such as carrying a cup of coffee. Safe control of such underactuated objects need to predict, preempt or compensate for self-generated perturbations of the liquid that presents forces acting back onto the hand. 
In our experiment, participants transported a semicircular cup with a heavy ball rolling inside (simulating the sloshing coffee) in a virtual environment, interfaced with a robotic manipulandum. They moved the cup-and-ball on a horizontal line to a target box. Due to the internal dynamics, the cup trajectory significantly deviates from a bell-shape velocity profile common in unconstrained movements. It also deviates from the two-peaked profile that is predicted by an effort-minimizing optimal controller that minimally intervenes with forces generated by the rolling ball. To reproduce the observed cup velocity profile (which has small positive acceleration in the middle), two modifications of the optimal feedback controller were needed: First, hand impedance accounts for the participants’ compliant behavior when facing perturbations (included as a linear spring/damper at the cup). Second, the controller seeks to regulate the zero-force trajectory of the spring/damper with maximal smoothness. As long as the object dynamics is simple, as for a rigid object, both the original and the modified control models result in bell-shaped velocity profiles. However, when coping with interaction forces from the object, the dynamically-informed smoothness criterion is superior as it penalizes changes in cup velocity. These findings show that to gain insight into human control, we need to go beyond the highly simplified tasks to gain insights into human behavior with real-life challenges.

The computational power of biological dendritic trees,"Physiological experiments have highlighted how the dendrites of biological neurons can nonlinearly process distributed synaptic inputs. This is in stark contrast to units in artificial neural networks that are generally linear apart from an output nonlinearity. If dendritic trees can be nonlinear, biological neurons may have far more computational power than their artificial counterparts. Here we use a simple model where the dendrite is implemented as a sequence of thresholded linear units. We find that such dendrites can readily solve machine learning problems, such as MNIST or CIFAR-10, and that they benefit from having the same input onto several branches of the dendritic tree. This dendrite model is a special case of sparse network. This work suggests that popular neuron models may severely underestimate the computational power enabled by the biological fact of nonlinear dendrites and multiple synapses per pair of neurons.

It is also of growing importance in fields that use behavioral assays in model organisms, such as addiction and mental health research. While off-the-shelf solutions exist for many laboratory animals, monkeys have proven especially challenging and require a bespoke solution. We recently developed a tracking system for rhesus macaques called OpenMonkeyStudio (Bala et al., 2020). Like other supervised approaches, our system makes use of machine learning based on carefully annotated example datasets. However, like other approaches, ours has a major limitation: it cannot generalize to new joints that were not explicitly trained through annotated examples. Here we describe two novel approaches that can do this. First, the prediction of novel 2D key points via 3D MLP augmentation and second, a 50-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with point rendering supervision to perform full 3D segmentation of our macaque subjects. We then project the 3D voxel space into a mesh space using the marching cubes algorithm and overlay the 2D image textures. Our initial supervised training set used 13 joints; our new approach can track arbitrarily many, including a deformable mesh grid for the entire body of arbitrary density. For example, we demonstrate a version with 30,000 points on the subject’s body. One benefit of this approach is that we can perform high resolution head position and orientation tracking, thus giving us a rudimentary estimate of gaze direction.

recPUsBvdp5Yd2TMS,"Motion extrapolation in the flash-lag effect depends on perceived, rather than physical speed","In the flash-lag effect (FLE), a flashed object in spatiotemporal alignment with a moving object is often misperceived as lagging behind the moving object. One proposed explanation for the illusion is based on predictive motion extrapolation and argues that the visual system constantly predicts the position for the moving object in the present moment, in order to compensate for the time required for neural transmission and processing. In this interpretation, the visual system uses an estimate of the object’s velocity to generate a prediction, which implies that the FLE should rely on an explicit neural representation of velocity. By contrast, alternative explanations of the FLE based on differential latencies or temporal averaging should not be dependent on such a representation of velocity. Here, we test the extrapolation hypothesis by investigating the effect of illusory changes in perceived speed on the magnitude of the FLE in two experiments. In Experiment 1, we manipulated perceived speed by adding temporal noise to a rotating wedge stimulus, and in Experiment 2 we manipulated perceived speed by changing the luminance contrast of the wedge. We show for both manipulations, differences in perceived speed corresponded to differences in FLE magnitude: both perceived speed and perceived flash-lag increased when the wedge contained dynamic noise relative to static noise, and when it was presented in low relative to high contrast. Moreover, this effect was consistent across two different textures. Our findings therefore indicate that the FLE depends on an explicit neural representation of velocity, consistent with the motion extrapolation hypothesis.",Jane Yook,"Jane Yook, Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Cognitive Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-3), Forschungszentrum Jülich, Department of Psychology, Faculty of Human Sciences, University of Cologne; Lysha Lee, Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, The University of Melbourne; Simone Vossel, Cognitive Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-3), Forschungszentrum Jülich, Department of Psychology, Faculty of Human Sciences, University of Cologne; Ralph Weidner, Cognitive Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-3), Forschungszentrum Jülich; Hinze Hogendoorn, Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, The University of Melbourne",University of Melbourne (grid.1008.9),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-28 09:30:00+00:00,2020-10-28 09:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/hmQSEoKqJEM

Neighboring synapses on a dendritic branch can interact in a synergistic, cooperative manner via the nonlinear voltage-dependence of NMDA receptors. The single-branch clusteron learning algorithm (Mel 1991) takes advantage of this nonlinearity to solve classification tasks by randomly shuffling the locations of ""under-performing"" synapses on a model dendrite during learning (“structural plasticity”), eventually resulting in synapses with correlated activity being placed next to each other on the dendrite. We propose an alternative model, the gradient clusteron, or G-clusteron, which uses an analytically-derived gradient descent rule where synapses are ""attracted to"" or ""repelled from"" each other in an input- and location- dependent manner. We demonstrate the classification ability of this algorithm by testing it on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and show that, when using a softmax activation function, the accuracy of the G-clusteron on the All-vs-All MNIST task (86.5%) approaches that of logistic regression (88.9%).

It has been suggested that endogenous neuronal oscillations can synchronise to rhythmic stimulation, a phenomenon widely termed entrainment.
 Motivated by the plethora of studies showing the involvement of neuronal gamma oscillations (~30-100 Hz) in cognition, we aimed to study to what extent photic stimulation at frequencies >50 Hz drives ongoing gamma oscillations in the human brain. To this end, we systematically investigated oscillatory responses to a rhythmic flicker in absence and presence of endogenous gamma oscillations using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Utilising a high-frequency projector, we superimposed the photic stimulation, with frequencies ranging from 52 to 90 Hz, onto an invisible circular patch and moving grating stimuli known to reliably induce gamma oscillations, respectively. Power and phase-locking were found to decrease approximately linearly with increasing flicker frequency; with no amplification at individually preferred frequencies, suggesting that the visual system did not resonate within the stimulation range. Unexpectedly, this was also the case when gamma oscillations were induced. Moreover, the rhythmic stimulation did not appear to modulate the frequency or phase of the gamma oscillations. Rather, the results indicate a co-existence of both responses, with the sources of the flicker response and the gamma oscillations peaking at significantly different locations in visual cortex.

PaS neurons are divided into 3 main classes: WFS1 positive excitatory neurons, Reelin positive interneurons, and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. Using in vitro patch-clamp recordings, we analyzed the electrophysiological profile of more than 500 PaS neurons. Immunolabelling information was available only for ~50% of the dataset. Of this, the vast majority were WFS1+ positive neurons.  A small proportion was Reelin-positive that exhibited similar electrophysiological properties to WFS1, while the least represented class was PV interneurons. For such a multiclass and imbalanced dataset with similar electrophysiological features for the WFS1 and Reelin classes, the commonly used threshold analyses or clustering approaches were inefficient to predict the class of the remaining neurons. Thus, we designed and developed a machine learning classification pipeline to predict the class of our PaS neurons. Firstly, we implemented and tested multiple classification algorithms, including Support Vector Classifier, Complement Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor classifier, Multilayer Perceptron Model (MLP), and the Random Forest Classifier (RF). Using exclusively the dataset where the immunolabelling information was available, we used stratification and cross-validation, to test the performance of the models.

We continued by training and extensively testing the performance of our two best models, the RF and MLP. Finally, we used them to label the neurons lacking immunolabelling data.

Analysis of spike interval histograms of extracellular recordings of these cells identifies several distinct types based on firing pattern, including varied features such as doublets, long refractory periods, and oscillations in excitability, in particular a distinct 3Hz oscillation. We have been using integrate-and-fire based modelling in an attempt to determine whether these variations are more likely based on varied intrinsic electrophysiological properties, or may be a result of network interactions. Some cell types can be matched by single neuron models. The more complex types appear to require a network. A homogeneous network of random synaptically connected model neurons with long duration hyperpolarising after-potential (HAP), was able to reproduce some of the more complex cell types, including rhythm generating behaviour. Adding a depolarising afterpotential to the neurons, the network could also reproduce bistable behaviour that might underlie decision making mechanisms. However the homogeneous network could not match the oscillatory cells, which do not show the long HAP necessary to generate the rhythm. The solution was to use a network population of two distinct cell types, one with a short HAP and the other with a long HAP. The slow HAP cells synchronise to produce a 3Hz rhythm. This forms a network input signal to the fast HAP cells, producing firing that closely, and consistently, matches recorded oscillatory cells.

In addition, psychophysiological and dynamic causal modeling analyses revealed that the connection strength between inhibitory outputs from amygdala to medial dorsal and ventral posterior medial thalamus predicted individual differences in responsiveness to taste stimulation.

recPmY0tnZR3e7uh0,Astrocytic mitochondria regulates astrocytes morphogenesis and supports synaptogenesis,"The mechanisms controlling the postnatal maturation of astrocytes play a crucial role in ensuring a correct synaptogenesis. Here we explore the functional significance of mitochondrial activity for post-natal maturation of astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. We show that postnatal morphogenesis of astrocytes is critically dependent on the transient up-regulation of metabolic regulator PPARγ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) which is required for determining the highly interconnected functional network of mitochondria and then for providing an efficient bioenergetic supply in the developing astrocytes. The integrity of the elongated mitochondrial network depends on the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) via a direct modulation of PGC-1α. We also report that perturbation of mitochondria network and function by ablation of the PGC-1α or of the mGluR5 in the developing astrocytes leads to a delayed morphogenesis of astrocytes and an impairment in the formation and function of neighbouring synapses, whereas genetic re-expression of PGC-1α in astrocytes restores mitochondrial functions and ameliorates both astroglial and neuronal defects. Together with the finding of the development-associated enhancement of mitochondrial function in astrocytes, our results uncover mitochondria activity as a novel mechanism controlling astrocyte morphogenesis and supporting synaptogenesis, thus identifying the mitochondrial function of the developing astrocytes as potential target to ameliorate the formation and function of synapses.

recPmZyxxfdLecycl,Gaze Behavior changes following motor learning in a gait training task,"Vision plays a vital role in motor task execution and motor planning. During walking, where an individual looks and the distribution of their fixation locations provides insight into the preferred motor control strategies. Fixation distributions are well characterized in healthy adults and show consistent differences among individuals with gait deficits (who emphasize fixations involved in motor execution) and elite athletes (who emphasize fixations involved in motor planning). However, how individuals change their gaze distribution and the relationship to motor performance, is not understood. The present study examines how healthy young adults shift their gaze behavior during a locomotor learning task. Participants completed a treadmill-based sequence stepping task where they had to continuously step onto projected targets. The targets appeared in a repeating 6-step sequence of different step lengths which participants implicitly learned over multiple trial blocks. We hypothesized that participants would shift their gaze location forward (e.g. 2-3 steps ahead), emphasizing motor planning, as they learned the sequence. Our results did not support this hypothesis. With practice participants did learn the 6 step sequence and reduce their step error, however their gaze shifted closer to their feet, with participants spending more time fixating on the current target and immediate step path. This finding suggests that participants emphasized motor execution over motor planning while learning the task. Possible explanations for this result include a change in confidence, as awareness of their step errors may change step performance, or a change in information value, such that by learning the sequence, participants did not need visual information to plan their steps and could focus on optimizing stepping execution. Future studies should expand on these results with more complex stepping sequences, by artificially challenging participants’ confidence, and by disrupting visual informational value to see if gaze can be shifted in the opposite direction.",Alex Cates,"Keith Gordon, Northwestern University",Northwestern University (grid.16753.36),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-29 13:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 13:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/-ofuaF0ncN4
recPmfAiGyPk247Ou,What is the potential of decoding?: A time course comparison between ERP and machine learning classification analyses,"Neural decoding is a popular method in cognitive research. With decoding, neural data from individual trials or batches are categorized by a statistical classifier (e.g. support vector machines, SVM, or deep neural networks). However, neural decoding analyses stand in contrast to traditional event related potential (ERP) analyses, which average EEG data across same-condition trials to enhance voltage signals related to a particular experimental manipulation. This study set out to assess the differences in the timecourse of voltage signals obtained via task-based ERP versus the  information gain obtained via item-based neural decoding analyses. To do so, participants completed two target identification tasks (targets could be a face or body) under different visual presentations (Single vs RSVP presentation), which have previously been shown to elicit latency differences in target-related ERP components like the P3 (Craston, Wyble & Bowman, 2006). Recorded data was analyzed using conventional ERP techniques as well as machine learning classification techniques (in this case, a linear SVM trained to classify face from body trials within presentation format). The two analyses provided different conclusions about the influences of presentation format on cognitive processes, with ERP replicating the previously observed differences in P3 amplitudes and latencies whereas machine learning  demonstrated no substantial differences in classification accuracy or latency between formats. Overall, these results highlight the importance of comparing ERP and decoding analysis techniques in EEG. If decoding is driven by the voltage signals present in ERPs, one might have assumed that differences in ERP latencies would be reflected in the temporal profile of classification. However, this was not true.  The failure to find a clear correspondence between condition differences in the timecourse of  ERPs and decoding profiles suggests that classifiers are finding statistical regularities in target-related scalp voltages that are not scaling with traditional task-based ERPs measures.

recPoaS7LC7qUlWAV,Using Functional Connectivity to Predict Working Memory Performance in the Human Connectome Project,"Introduction: A central goal of neuroscience is predicting behavior based on features of the brain. Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) and task evoked functional connectivity are both commonly utilized measures of in vivo brain function. Utilizing data from the HCP, our project sought to explore their potential as a predictor for various other aspects of neural function and behavior. We attempted to predict working memory task performance based on patterns of task evoked activity and rsFC. We theorized that task based activity would be more predictive than rsFC.

Methods: In a subset (n = 338) of the Human Connectome Project, we used the Glasser parcellation to establish functional connectivity patterns during resting state as features to model. As the first preprocessing step, we generated a functional connectivity matrix for all parcels across all participants. Separate matrices were created for each task and resting state separately. We then utilized connectome parametric mapping (CPM, Shen et al, 2017) to model the prediction of working memory performance.

Results: Resting-state was found as a better predictor (R2= 13%) of behavioral performance respect to task-evoked working memory (R2= 0.5%) activity. However, the overall predictive power of either model was not high. Nodes belonging to the default mode and frontal parietal network were found to better predict working memory performance. 

Discussion: Interestingly, resting state was a better predictor of WM performance than the WM task activity, but overall performance was not high. Nodes belonging to the frontal-parietal network were more engaged in the working memory task than nodes in the default mode network. The narrow differences between task evoked and rsFC may partially explain the difference in model performance. Another potential contributing factor is the comparatively smaller amount of task-evoked activity to the rsFC. These factors have considerations for building predictive models using fMRI data.

recPrk5ndpPonoURk,Parallel pathways of odor processing in the lateral entorhinal cortex,"Layer II principal cells in lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) receive olfactory sensory input from the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex and relay this information to the hippocampus. Distinct types of layer II cells direct information via two parallel pathways: fan cells send direct projections to the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells project to CA1. However, little is known about the role of the LEC in the processing of odor information. Here we use acute optogenetic silencing in head-fixed mice performing two-alternative-forced-choice (2AFC) tasks to show that the LEC is necessary for rapid (<300 ms of odor inhalation) discrimination of odor identity and intensity. Consistent with these rapid behavioral responses, simultaneous silicon probe recordings in the awake state from the LEC and hippocampus reveal that virtually all olfactory-evoked activity occurs in a brief time window coupled to odor inhalation. Using brain slice recordings, we show that direct input from the olfactory bulb preferentially targets LEC fan cells, whereas input from the piriform cortex equally targets fan and pyramidal cells. This results in faster onset of odor evoked activity and more selective responses in fan cells, as well as better odor discrimination at the population level.",Sebastian Bitzenhofer,"Sebastian H.

recPvpGEwwqjRdFYf,Age-related double dissociation of fast and slow theta oscillations in children and adolescents,"Neuronal oscillations are ubiquitous and associated with processes ranging from physiological to cognitive to pathological. These periodic rhythms change considerably during development, making understanding their development fundamental to understanding brain development. However, typical scalp EEG does not access medial brain areas directly and offers low spatial resolution of the lateral areas it does access. Noninvasive EEG therefore offers a limited window into brain development and, as we consider here, the development of cognitive processes such as declarative memory which rely on the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and its connections to specific lateral prefrontal (PFC) areas. To circumvent this issue, we capitalized on a unique opportunity to record EEG directly from the brains of pediatric neurosurgical patients undergoing invasive clinical monitoring for seizure management. 

In this study, 21 children and adolescents (5.9-20.5 years) undergoing direct cortical monitoring (i.e., ECoG) attended to visual scenes in preparation for a memory recognition test. We isolated ECoG signals from 80 channels in MTL and 357 channels in PFC. We focused on theta rhythms, which are defined by a frequency of 3-8 Hz and consistently linked to memory processes in the MTL of adults as well as animal models. After disentangling oscillatory components from aperiodic 1/f activity, we detected at faster rhythm ~7 Hz which sped up with age and a slower rhythm ~3 Hz which slowed down with age. These results reveal that: (1) recent findings of fast and slow theta rhythms in the adult MTL extend to children; (2) both rhythms are also evident in PFC; and (3) development is associated with the functional differentiation of theta oscillations. Further analyses show that both theta oscillations support MTL-PFC functional connectivity patterns predictive of subsequent memory formation, suggesting that the functional differentiation of theta oscillations relates to the development of declarative memory.",Lisa Johnson,"Qin Yin, Wayne State University; Lingfei Tang, Wayne State University; Eishi Asano, Wayne State University; Noa Ofen, Wayne State University","University of California, Berkeley (grid.47840.3f)","Theme A: Development, Neurodegenerative Disorders and Injury",Traditional talk,2020-10-26 21:00:00+00:00,2020-10-26 21:15:00+00:00,
recPwgFo9TzEKFEpO,Distinct synaptic plasticity timescales enable engram (de-)maturation in systems consolidation,"In a contextual fear conditioning experiment, prefrontal cortex engram cells are formed in a silent state but undergo a process of maturation as a result of systems consolidation. In contrast, hippocampal engram cells are initially generated in a mature state and later withstand de-maturation. It has been proposed that these engram dynamics are not restricted to fear memories but instead are characteristic of episodic memory engrams. However, the exact mechanisms underlying engram (de-)maturation have not been investigated yet. Here, we present a spiking network model of systems consolidation that exhibits both maturation of cortical and de-maturation of hippocampal engram cells. Our model contains individual subnetworks for the thalamus, cortex, and hippocampus with excitatory and inhibitory synapses within and between these regions being subject to plasticity mechanisms at different rates. In this model, cortical engram cells are initially silent in recent recall but mature and become active in remote recall after a consolidation period. Inversely, hippocampal engrams are active in recent but not in remote recall and, hence, de-mature. Hippocampal engram cells as well as spontaneous synchronized reactivations in the three brain regions in our model were crucial for systems consolidation of memories. Importantly, the above engram dynamics and interdependencies displayed by our model are aligned with previous experimental findings. Our model also makes the following experimentally testable predictions: engram cells in mediodorsal thalamus (MD) are active in recent and remote recall and are essential for the maturation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) engram cells, PFC inhibitory engram cells become selective to stimuli with systems consolidation, and the coupling between MD and PFC prior to consolidation is predictive of the retrograde amnesia curve induced by hippocampal damage. Overall, our modelling results suggest that a variety of synaptic plasticity mechanisms operating over distinct timescales across brain regions is coordinated to promote systems consolidation.",Douglas Feitosa Tomé,"Sadra Sadeh, Imperial College London; Claudia Clopath, Imperial College London",Imperial College London (grid.7445.2),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-28 17:15:00+00:00,2020-10-28 17:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/TSQtd21J-5s
recPzPNvAw721tbH3,Role of Electrode Preparation on Static Impedance in Electroconvulsive Therapy ,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has long been recognized as an effective treatment for neurological disorders; chief among them is major depressive disorder. The preparation of skin and electrodes for ECT is an important procedure, but there is significant variability in electrode preparation protocols used and questions about which steps are important. Static impedance, measured by the ECT device prior to administration of ECT, is used to indicate the quality of electrode setup. The current pilot study examined the contributions of skin preparation on static impedance in healthy subjects. Using adhesive ECT electrodes, six electrode placements procedures were considered: saline skin preparation with conducting gel PRE TAC, 70% isopropyl alcohol skin preparation, saline skin preparation with PRE TAC and 50% electrode contact area, 70% isopropyl alcohol skin preparation with PRE TAC, saline skin preparation with 1% PVP-K90 application, saline skin preparation with 1% PVP-K90 application plus KCL. Electrodes were placed in the bifrontal position on the forehead. Static impedance was measured every minute using two commercial ECT machines for 17 minutes, or until impedance stabilized. All preparations containing an adhesive, namely PRE TAC and the PVP-K90 solutions, had improved adhesion of electrode onto skin, resulting in lower static impedance. The absence of adhesive (alcohol skin preparation only) drove up static impedance. These results suggest that even under apparent full electrode coverage the quality of electrode-skin contact impacts static impedance. Intentionally reducing contact area of electrode to skin by ~50% increased impedance by a factor of ~2x. The results also demonstrate significant difference among individuals, even under our tightly controlled experimental conditions with optimal preparation, indicating that head impedance contributes to impedance measurements. Improving adhesion of the electrode to skin reduces impedance despite this variability.

We address this question by estimating transfer entropy from state-space Granger causality modeling on intracranial EEG (iEEG) data. In an exploratory analysis, we conduct pairwise and groupwise conditional Granger causality on a high-frequency broadband envelope of iEEG signals recorded from 10 epileptic patients. The high-frequency broadband envelope has been shown to be highly correlated with local neural population firing rates, and so is a relevant biomarker of local neural activity. We model information flow between visually responsive populations in three distincts conditions: a resting state condition, a place stimulus presentation and a face stimulus presentation. In each of these conditions we examine the magnitudes of top-down and bottom-up information flow between visually responsive neural populations in both higher and lower areas of the occipito-temporal cortical hierarchy. Signals are treated as multivariate, multiple-trial time series, for which we show that state space modeling yields stable models from which Granger causality can be inferred - a difficult challenge given the non-stationarity of the signals involved. From these state-space models, we first infer groupwise conditional Granger causality between visually responsive functional groups of channels, to model information flow between functional regions along the occipito-temporal hierarchy. We then run a pairwise-conditional Granger causality analysis between individual visually responsive channels in these groups, to further explore modes of information transfer in local neural populations between and within visually responsive sites. The aim of this exploratory study is to motivate hypotheses about distinct modes of top-down and bottom-up information flow between face and non-face selective regions of the visual cortex.",Guillaume Corlouer,"Guillaume Corlouer, Sackler center for consciousness science and Department of Informatics, University of Sussex,  Falmer,Brighton, BN1 9QJ, UK; Yitzhak Norman, Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, 76100, Rehovot, Israel;   Rafael Malach; Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, 76100, Rehovot, Israel, CIFAR Program on Brain, Mind, and Consciousness, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Lionel Barnett, Sackler center for consciousness science and Department of Informatics, University of Sussex,  Falmer,Brighton, BN1 9QJ, UK; Anil Seth, Sackler center for consciousness science and Department of Informatics, University of Sussex,  Falmer,Brighton, BN1 9QJ, UK, CIFAR Program on Brain, Mind, and Consciousness, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Ashesh D.

recQ2qUWqGiDHIRL4,Ultra-sparse spike sequences for automatic recognition of auditory objects,"In the last few years, Deep Learning has tremendously improved the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. It has also been applied to related tasks, such as birdsong syllable recognition [2]. However, this success comes at the expense of large amounts of training data and computational power. When data is scarce, the performance tends to decrease rapidly. This hinders applications where high accuracy is required from a limited amount of labeled exemplars.

Here we explore a radically different approach to the task of auditory object recognition from continuous sound streams. Our approach is inspired by how the auditory system represents auditory objects. Namely, that neurons in high auditory areas fire sparsely and in patterns that correlate with specific auditory objects. In addition, these patterns are also seen to be robust against noise.

We train feature-detecting neurons that respond to acoustic structures within short-time windows of about 50 ms. Together, these neurons transform the sound input into a continuous stream of spikes. This spike representation is ultra-sparse and precisely timed. Auditory objects consisting of well defined spectrotemporal structures are then stored as templates of spike sequences. During testing, a template matching algorithm performs the search, discovery and classification of spike sequences in the continuous sound input.

Our contribution is two-fold. First, we demonstrate our approach in the task of segmenting and classifying Bengalese finch syllables from continuous birdsong recordings. We show that our system generalizes well even when only a few syllables are available for training. Second, we make available to the community a new open-source software for audio data annotation, which we call BASS. Our software is designed to allow users to quickly mark, compare and classify segments extracted from spectrograms. We find it particularly useful for manually annotating large sets of birdsong data.

Here we asked whether neurons could be reliably tracked across recordings with Neuropixels probes, which allow access not only to the cortex but also to deep brain structures and can resolve individual spikes. We implanted mice with novel Neuropixels 2.0 probes that can have one shank or four shanks, and have more tightly spaced recording sites compared to commercially available Neuropixel 1.0 probes. We implanted the probes vertically through primary visual cortex and cemented them to the cranium. For recordings, mice were head-fixed in front of computer screens. Recordings were performed at regular intervals. Recordings yielded many neurons across >6 months, but there was substantial drift across sessions. To compensate for it, we used a modified version of Kilosort2 algorithm. To characterize the neurons, during each recording we presented a library of natural images. Many V1 neurons responded to these images and showed a pattern of preferences that constituted a unique signature. Using this signature we followed the activity of these neurons over the course of days, weeks and months.

Under dopaminergic treatments, Parkinson´s disease (PD) patients may develop impulse control disorders (ICDs) resulting in excessive behaviours towards appetitive items, hence representing an optimal human model to study addiction. The wide spectrum of excessive approach tendencies towards appetitive options include primary and secondary rewards such as binge eating, hypersexuality, pathological gambling or compulsive shopping. In addition, the neurocognitive profile of ICD is marked by preference of immediate gratification and lack of adaptation to negative outcomes paralleled by enhanced signalling of the mesocortical valuation system. To date, the precise behavioural and neural changes involved in ICD are unclear. More precisely, is unclear whether ICD is a deficit of impulsive choice or impulsive actions that cannot override excessive desire of appetitive items. Here, evidence will be presented to put forward the field on one specific ICD (i.e. hypersexuality) in choice behaviour and action impulsivity (using fMRI and computational modelling). Ultimately, preliminary findings may support a transfer towards clinical consequences that will impact ICD with neuromodulation techniques.

In 1984 they managed to identify a gene that encodes a protein that accumulates during the night but is degraded during the day. They also identified additional proteins that form part of a self-regulating biological clockwork in the fruit fly's cells. The same principles have been shown to apply to other animals and plants.",Michael Rosbash ,,Brandeis University,"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Keynote Event,2020-10-28 19:00:00+00:00,2020-10-28 20:00:00+00:00,
recQFQYGoXCw3S8CW,Cell-type specific nonlinearities in frontal-sensory integration in the parietal cortex,"Top-down influences, including memory and attention, strongly affect sensory processing. Yet, synaptic interaction of cognitive and sensory information streams remains largely undescribed. Non-linear interactions have been frequently observed during multisensory processing, however, technical challenges so far prohibited the mechanistic exploration of how top-down and bottom-up afferents interact. Here, we employ a dual-color optogenetic strategy to determine the spatiotemporal features of multi-modal synaptic integration in the mouse posterior parietal cortex (PPC). We expressed a red light sensitive channelrhodopsin variant in the primary auditory cortex (A1) and a blue light sensitive opsin in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a frontal region commonly associated with attention and working memory. This opsin combination allowed independent control of sensory and frontal inputs to the PPC. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings in acute brain slices we show that the PPC receives direct, monosynaptic inputs from both A1 and ACC. Similarly to other cortical areas, layer 5 principal cells in the PPC show heterogeneity in their firing patterns. We found that two classes of pyramidal neurons, intrinsically bursting and regular spiking, have distinct patterns of frontal-sensory integration. Intrinsically bursting cells displayed a supralinear enhancement of coincident input from ACC and A1, an effect that diminished with increasing delays between inputs. Conversely, regular spiking cells showed maximal enhancement when afferents were activated with delay, and robust suppression of coincident inputs. Intriguingly, we also found that co-activating frontal and sensory inputs significantly enhanced sustained activity in the PPC microcircuit, indicating a potential role in working memory processes. Our data suggest that frontal-sensory integration has cell-type specificity in the PPC, and begins to unravel the circuit architecture of multi-modal integration.

recQM0q3bRn7GDoV8, Prolactin-induced changes in the primary auditory cortex plasticity,"During pregnancy and lactation there are multiple adaptive changes in the mother’s brain that
are essential for the survival of the progeny. Clinical and experimental evidences indicate that
prolactin (PRL), present during lactation, can contribute to the development of these adaptive
modifications. While the importance of the endocrine system on the activity of neuronal
network in critical stages of life is well stablished, the role of PRL on the remodeling of the
auditory cortex (AC) in response to sound stimuli emitted by the pups during lactation is still
unknown. Therefore, the aim of this project is to study the modifications on neural activity of
the AC in a model of hyperprolactinemia. To reach this objective, we used electrophysiological
techniques with chronic electrode implants in the primary auditory cortex (A1) in order to record
auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). The recordings were conducted in awake animals treated
with domperidone (as the model of hyperprolactinemia) and in control animals treated with a
vehicle. For the auditory stimuli we used recordings of pup’s vocalizations during lactation
(wriggling calls), as well as trials of pure tones at different frequencies. Our data suggest that an
increase in serum levels of PRL modifies the AEPs registered in A1. Specifically, there is a loss of
the fundamental frequencies within 0.1-20 Hz band of the AEPs following stimulations with
pups’ vocalizations. This result suggests that PRL induces changes in mother’s auditory pathway

Detected body parts must first be connected and associated with animals, which is a costly combinatorial task. Animals’ motion must then be tracked frame by frame, and the resulting trajectories stitched together to ensure dynamic feasibility and disambiguate overlaps and identity switches. Here we introduce DeepLabCut 2.2, a framework built onto the open-source pose estimation toolbox DeepLabCut to address the multi-animal scenario.

We introduce V1Net -- a bio-inspired recurrent unit implementing linear and nonlinear excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) lateral connections; spatial convolutional layers in DCNs can be substituted with V1Net to create a V1Net-DCN. We compare the performance of a shallow V1Net-DCN against 15 carefully selected feedforward and recurrent neural architectures (including state-of-the-art DCNs) on the MarkedLong and Pathfinder challenges -- two synthetic image classification tasks based on low-level grouping with 1 million images each. Our results demonstrate that a compact 3-layer V1Net-DCN matches or outperforms the test accuracy and sample efficiency of all comparison models with varied capacity and architectural diversity. Our experiments are suggestive of the importance of implementing recurrent long-range E-I horizontal connections to enhance the low-level grouping abilities of feedforward deep learning models.

Previous studies have found that pediatric patients with resections of the ventral visual pathway still retain normal visuoperceptual abilities. It is not clear whether visuomotor computations, carried out by the dorsal pathway, follow a similar behavioral pattern. To address this outstanding issue, we examined visuomotor and visuoperceptual behaviors in a pediatric patient TC, who has a cortical resection that includes portions of the left ventral and dorsal pathways.  TC used her right and left hands to estimate perceptually the width of blocks that varied in width and length (but not in overall size), and, in a separate condition, to grasp the same objects across their width. Consistent with previous studies, TC’s perceptual performance was comparable to that of controls.  In contrast, TC was markedly impaired in her visuomotor sensitivity to object shape but only when she grasped the objects with her contralesional right (and not ipsilesional left) hand. These results provide novel evidence for a striking difference in the reorganization profiles of the two visual pathways. This difference might be attributed to a greater degree of hemispheric specialization of the dorsal pathway, or, alternatively, to differential maturation rates of the two pathways, such that the dorsal pathway maturation precedes that of the ventral pathway.",Zoha Ahmad,"Zoha Ahmad, York University; Marlene Behrmann, Carnegie Mellon University; Christina Patterson, University of Pittsburgh; Erez Freud, York University ",York University (grid.21100.32),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-26 18:00:00+00:00,2020-10-26 18:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/IdKeguE6xBI

Here, we investigate whether reward-based motor learning is possible in a multi-dimensional trajectory matching task and whether simplifying the task by providing feedback on one factor at a time (‘factorized feedback’) can improve learning. In two experiments, participants performed a trajectory matching task in which learning was measured as a reduction in the error. In Experiment 1, participants matched a straight trajectory slanted in depth. We factorized the task by providing feedback on the slant error, the length error, or on their composite. In Experiment 2, participants matched a curved trajectory, also slanted in depth. In this experiment, we factorized the feedback by providing feedback on the slant error, the curvature error, or on the integral difference between the matched and target trajectory. In both experiments, participants learnt the multidimensional task: they reduced errors in the matched trajectory. There was no evidence that the factorization of feedback improved learning.

Obtaining stable, chronic recording of unitary activities from multiple sub-regions of the hippocampus in behaving animals is crucial for studying the biological basis of memoryformation and is also the foundation for developinghippocampal memory prosthesis. However, severe immune response caused by micro-motion between stiff implants and brain tissue often limits the lifetime of penetrating neural probes. To reduce the stiffness mismatch between recording devices and brain tissue, we developed and tested a flexible, Parylene-based multi-electrode array for recording from multiple sub-regions of the rat hippocampus and used this array to collect chronic neural activities from free moving rats. The 64 channels, Parylene multi-electrode array has eight shanks arranged in series with 250μmspacing. On each shank, eight recording electrodes were divided into two groups targeting at the CA3 and the CA1 sub-regions, respectively. The layout of recording sites is specially designed to conformto the curvature of the hippocampal cell body layers.Stereotactic surgery is conducted to chronically implant the flexible array. A dissolvable brace that temporarily reduces effective probe length is used to insert the bare array without buckling.Signals were monitored during the insertion and after recovery, while the animal is exploring freely in an open field. Eleven animals were implanted with the Parylene array. 70 out of 78(90%) implanted functional shanks recorded from at least one sub-region and 50% shanks recorded spike activities from both the CA1 and the CA3 sub-regionsduring the implantation.

However, to date no studies have examined speech processing at the subcortical level in children with HL. Moreover, the effects of amplification on the neural encoding of speech remain poorly understood, with previous data suggesting a benefit at the subcortical but not the cortical level.
Here, I will present a study aiming to investigate (1) the subcortical and cortical processing of speech sounds in children with HL, and (2) the effects of amplification on the neural processing of speech, in children with HL. Subcortical and cortical EEG activity evoked by speech stimuli were simultaneously recorded in n = 18, 8- to 16-year old children with HL and n = 15 age-matched NH controls. The frequency-following-response (FFR) and MMN were used as indices of speech processing at the subcortical and cortical levels, respectively. For the HL group, stimuli were presented both unamplified (70 dB SPL), and with a frequency-specific gain (without compression) based on their individual audiograms. 
At the subcortical level, children with HL showed a smaller FFR than NH controls’ in the unamplified condition. With simulated amplification, the FFR of the HL group was comparable to that of NH controls. At the cortical level, there was no significant MMN in children with HL presented with either unamplified or amplified speech. 
The neural processing of unamplified speech may be impaired at both subcortical and cortical levels in children with HL. Moreover, amplification may benefit auditory processing at subcortical but not cortical levels in this group. I will offer two alternative explanations for our findings: increasing multi-sensory integration at successive levels of the auditory system, and/or later maturation of the auditory cortex compared to the inferior colliculus.

The impact of physical activity on affective behavior has been proposed to rely on peripheral metabolic feedback. Here we identify an insular cortex to BNST (insula→BNST) neuronal circuit recruited during active stress coping that modulates affective behavior.

However, it is unclear whether these putative systems learn independently from separate kinds of error, or compete to learn from the same error. Here, we mathematically express these two possibilities and consider their diverging predictions. When we test these predictions, we find that implicit and explicit systems share a common error; increases in explicit strategy siphon error away from the implicit system, thus impairing its learning. This negative interaction can mask changes in implicit learning such as savings and interference, that can be unveiled by suppressing explicit strategy. Together, the data suggest that in most cases, implicit and explicit systems are in competition to learn from a single error: task outcome. Cases that violate this rule suggest a second error source that also drives implicit adaptation, but leads to competition between two implicit learning modules. Altogether, the data show that patterns of implicit adaptation are shaped by competition between parallel learning systems.",Scott Albert,Jihoon Jang; Adrian Haith; Gonzalo Lerner; Valeria Della-Maggiore; John W.

recRQASJqCiuyvH6h,A connectomic substrate of credit assignment in basal ganglia reinforcement learning,"How is experience used to improve performance? In both biological and artificial systems, the optimization of parameters that affect the system’s behavior requires a credit assignment process that determines whether a parameter affects the outcome and then allows its modification.
Here we show, by combining high-throughput volume electron microscopy with flood-filling neural networks and automated synaptic connectivity inference, that the synaptic architecture of songbird basal ganglia supports a form of local credit assessment (related to node perturbation) proposed in a model of songbird reinforcement learning. Specifically, we demonstrate that the model’s major three predictions hold true: first, cortical feedback axons that encode exploratory motor variability terminate predominantly on dendritic shafts of spiny neurons. Second, cortical axons that encode timing terminate on dendritic spines, which enable calcium-based coincidence detection and appear to be capable of creating and storing eligibility traces. Third, synapse pairs that pre-synaptically share a cortical timing axon and post-synaptically a medium spiny dendrite are substantially more similar in size than expected, indicating a history of Hebbian plasticity. Consistent with the model, we then propose a novel role for cortical feedforward inhibition (FFI) in the striatum and test its anatomical predictions by directly identifying and analyzing triplet connectivity motifs in the connectome.
Finally, we performed numerical simulations of the proposed Hebbian 3-factor learning rule (context, action feedback and reward) and show that our model can learn to imitate a simple template in a realistic number of iterations. Combined with our connectomic data, this provides strong evidence for a model of vertebrate basal ganglia reinforcement learning with a biologically plausible credit assignment mechanism.

It has been shown that directed acyclic graphs are optimal structures for the synchronization of identical oscillators. However, feedback loops are required for noise-resistant synchronization of non-identical oscillators. On the other hand, the interaction structures of many real networks vary over time according to their dynamics. Here we employ a rewiring strategy based on an anti-Hebbian learning rule to modulate the structure of directed networks of Kuramoto oscillators. The results show that the anti-Hebbian learning rule leads to the global synchronization of the networks. Indeed, information flow is created from the nodes with average frequencies to the nodes with low or high frequencies in the emerged optimal structure, where the nodes with average frequencies are engaged only in the feed-forward loops, but the nodes with low and high frequencies are mostly joined together with the feedback loops. Similar results were also found in the Hybrid Excitatory-Inhibitory networks of oscillators. In the previous studies, the balance between neural excitation and inhibition has been shown to be crucial for brain computations.

This has motivated the development of algorithms to “extract” submovements from human experimental data. Fast decomposition algorithms, e.g. based on zero-crossings of progressively higher derivatives, result in spurious decompositions. Other algorithms, such as a scattershot algorithm (using stochastic Monte-Carlo methods) make fewer assumptions, but are not computationally efficient enough to handle the long data records common in continuous human actions (> 10 s). This work developed a modified stochastic algorithm to decompose long data profiles into discrete submovements. The modified algorithm broke long data profiles into uniform frames which were then decomposed using the scattershot algorithm and recombined.  To validate the frame-based algorithm, it was compared to the scattershot algorithm when long, synthetic data records were decomposed. We found that the frame-based approach achieved comparable performance to the scattershot algorithm while decreasing the run time to an approximately linear dependence on data length, compared to an exponential dependence for the scattershot algorithm. This new frame-based algorithm will make the decomposition of long data records with many submovements feasible in future human motor control experiments.

Experiments in animals typically involve long training periods. By contrast, real-world decisions often need to be made spontaneously between novel options. It is therefore possible that neural mechanisms targeted in animal studies differ from those required for novel decisions typically revealed in human imaging studies. Here we show that primate medial frontal cortex (MFC) has a causal role in novel inferential choices when options have not previously been experienced. Macaques spontaneously inferred values of new options via similarities with component parts of previously encountered options. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggested this ability was mediated by MFC, an area rarely investigated in monkeys; MFC activity reflected a different process of comparison for novel versus familiar options. A second fMRI experiment found that multidimensional option representations in MFC employed a grid-cell-like coding scheme, well known in the context of spatial navigation, to integrate dimensions in this non-physical space when making novel choices. By contrast, orbitofrontal cortex held specific object-based value representations. In a third experiment, minimally invasive ultrasonic disruption of MFC, but not adjacent tissue, altered estimation of novel choice values.

recRYf2AmphrIZluG,Cellular mechanisms for rapidly dynamic neural code in spatial navigation,"Navigation usually involves complex tasks that require neural representation of environments, with the flexibility to respond to rapidly dynamic behavioral or cognitive variables. For instance, in the hippocampus, a brain area important for navigation, relatively small changes in cues can quickly modulate the neural representation of space. Besides, animals also learn to form such neural maps incorporated with task-relevant information. Remarkably, these processes can happen as promptly as in no more than a few seconds.

Dynamic hippocampal coding likely supports a hallmark complexity of spatial cognition, but the cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this talk, I will discuss our recent findings that the rapid and flexible formation and adaptation of place-dependent neural firing could be mediated by nonlinear subcellular integration or via synaptic plasticity, through experiments applying whole-cell patch-clamp recording to CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices and in awake, behaving mice, as well as computational modeling. These results suggest a cellular and biophysical basis for neural computations fundamental to flexible and adaptive behavior.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computing system whose fundamental composition is analogous to biological neural networks. Where a node acts as soma, input acts as dendrites, weights or Interconnections acts as the synapse and the output acts as axon.Despite ANNs being a manifestation of the BNNs there exist a lot of differences.
The primary difference between ANNs and BNNs is different topologies: Instead of a network with asynchronous computing nodes, the ANNs compute one by one. Recurrent feedbacks are simulated in Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and Recurrent neural networks but general neural networks compute the state & weights of a layer of the neural network then use the result to compute the next layer while in backpropagation the weights are improvised.  Layers aren’t connected to non-neighbouring layers .IN BNNs the neurons can fire asynchronously parallelly, having dense neurons hubs and a large amount of lesser connected ones, partially following the power law (for the large values of k, the fraction P(k) of nodes in the network having k connections to other nodes as P(k) ~ k -z  where z generally lies from 2 to 3, although may lie outside these bounds ). Due to their topology the BNNs are better at fault and ambiguity tolerant as there is no central part, they can heal and are self-regenerated to some extent.The size of ANNs and BNNs also vary,there are 10 11 neurons in the brain whereas computational considerations limited ANNs nowadays to 10 5 neurons. As far as the energy consumption is concerned the human brain has nearly 20 watts of power consumption whereas a GPU (graphics processing unit) used for training artificial neural networks consumes somewhere from 150 to 250 watts, Human brain is highly efficient in comparison to the GPUs.Different between the ANNs and BNNs are (but not limited to) topologies,fault tolerance,size and energy consumption prominent differences between the BNNs and ANNs",krishna katyal he/him,"bradly alicea, orthogonal lab,usa",Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University (grid.440710.6),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-29 18:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 18:15:00+00:00,
recReIM3V36asnYKe,Neurotransmitter switches regulate motor learning and stress response,"Neurotransmitter switching, involving the loss of one neurotransmitter and gain of another in the same neuron, is a form of plasticity that regulates E/I balance and behavior (Li & Spitzer, 2020; Spitzer, 2017). We have identified neurotransmitter switching and its behavioral consequences in both healthy and stressed brains during adulthood. 
We find that one week of voluntary wheel running enhances the acquisition of motor skills in healthy adult mice. Running for one week also induces switching from acetylcholine to GABA expression in neurons in the midbrain pedunculopontine nucleus. Using viral vectors to override transmitter switching, either by expressing the enzymes for acetylcholine synthesis, or short hairpin RNAs interfering with the gain of enzymes for GABA synthesis, blocks the beneficial effect of running on motor skill learning (Li & Spitzer, 2020). These results show that neurotransmitter switching provides the basis by which sustained running benefits motor skill learning.
Under conditions of stress, we find that transmitter switching occurs following a traumatic fear experience. Two and four weeks after intense footshock stress, a subset of serotonergic neurons in the lateral wings of the dorsal raphe (lwDR) of adult mice have switched their co-transmitter from glutamate/vGluT3 (vesicular glutamate transporter type 3) to GABA/GAD67 (glutamic acid decarboxylase 67). At both time points, shocked mice show fear-related passive behaviors as they reduce exploration and increase freezing in a novel environment. We are now using Cre-dependent adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to express vGluT3 or suppress expression of GAD1 that encodes GAD67 in serotonergic lwDR neurons and testing the impact on the stress-induced sustained fear responses.
Our studies suggest that neurotransmitter switching, as a form of brain plasticity, links prior experience to subsequent alterations of behavior. We expect this research to lead to new insights into development of therapeutic methods for treating movement disorders and mental illnesses.",Huiquan Li,"Wuji Jiang, University of California, San Diego; Cong Chen, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of California San Diego; Don Cleveland, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of California San Diego; Nicholas C.

recRkjYskGN8imqRM,Mapping the building blocks of face processing in individuals with and without autism using microstate analysis,"Face processing undergoes significant changes during early development. Difficulties in facial processing and variability in neural processing of faces are common in individuals with autism across development. It remains unknown whether this individual variability in face processing between individuals with and without autism is better explained by qualitative differences in the involvement of different neural processing pathways or by quantitative differences in the neural processing of similar neural pathways.
In this study, we investigated spatial and temporal characteristics of face processing using electroencephalography in children with and without autism (N’s = 53 and 40), adolescents with and without autism (N’s = 79 and 68), and adults with and without autism (N’s = 90 and 74) from the Longitudinal European Autism Project. We applied multi-channel data-driven analyses to the event-related responses to upright and inverted faces (modulating configural face processing) and tested for qualitative differences in scalp topography with topographic analyses of variance and for quantitative differences in strength of these topographies with global field power comparisons. Next, we extracted distinct spatiotemporal microstates to examine neural timings for responses to faces for the different orientations and diagnostic groups. 
The neurotypical groups displayed distinct temporal and topographic profiles with different strengths for the upright and inverted faces. Topography and strength of the scalp profiles showed subtle differences between individuals with and without autism in the adolescents, but not in the children and adults. The microstate approach revealed quantitative differences between diagnostic groups during the early temporal stages of face processing, and qualitative differences between diagnostic groups during the later temporal stages of face processing across all age groups. 
Our findings demonstrate the importance of multi-channel spatiotemporal analytic approaches in investigating neural responses in neurodevelopmental disorders. Alterations emerging at early stages of development in autism may result in compensatory processes later in development.

In individuals with disorders of consciousness (DOC), the dynamic properties of functional connectivity of their brain networks are altered. Accurate assessment of level of consciousness in unresponsive patients and their potential to recover requires further understanding of the dynamic architecture of functional connectivity. In this study, we investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of dynamic properties of functional connectivity in individuals in an unresponsive or minimally responsive state. Time-resolved functional connectivity was estimated from high-density EEG using the weighted phase lag index (wPLI). The spatial-temporal organization of wPLI connectivity was assessed with a K-means clustering analysis and compared between 1) healthy adults; 2) DOC patients who recovered consciousness; 3) DOC patients who remained unresponsive; and 4) patients showing cognitive-motor dissociation. The robustness of the results was further evaluated using a hidden Markov model. We demonstrate that the dynamic organization of functional connectivity varies widely in DOC patients, and that these patterns differs from those which are observed in healthy adults. We demonstrate that the degree of preserved dynamic organization of time-resolved functional connectivity distinguishes unresponsive patients according to their state of consciousness and potential to recover consciousness. Our findings provide evidence for altered spatial-temporal patterns and dynamic properties of functional connectivity in unresponsive individuals.

We propose that the problem of overt and covert rhythm tracking is most naturally characterized as a problem of point process filtering: continuously estimating a hidden underlying phase based on the precise timing of temporally localized events that provide (incomplete) information about the phase. Here, we provide several mathematical framings of that problem at different levels of detail. We demonstrate that variational Bayesian solutions to this problem (specifically, point-process Kalman-Bucy filters) can be used to infer tempo as well as phase, and that they reproduce multiple characteristics of overt and covert human rhythm tracking including interval-dependent phase correction and the ``filled interval'' illusion. We point out that this approach to rhythm tracking fits nicely into the theory of predictive processing and active inference, and we discuss its plausibility in the human brain.",Jonathan Cannon,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology (grid.116068.8),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-27 16:00:00+00:00,2020-10-27 16:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/UeHSHwVW_Wg

If motion is global, however, in the sense that the same transformation is applied uniformly across the entire field of view, locations arbitrarily far apart can in principle be used for motion detection. One explanation for why this does not happen in the brain is that it would require long-distance connections that would be prohibitively expensive. Here we suggest that, in fact, a normative model that posits that the brain is adapted to natural visual statistics is sufficient to lead to localized interactions, even without considering the costs of long-range connections. Our model further provides a biologically plausible mechanism that can be used to learn the connectivity pattern for local motion detectors. We adapt a method initially designed for learning infinitesimal generators for global motion, and show that, when the training data contains localized patterns and/or localized motion, the learned generators naturally cluster into groups involving small sets of nearby pixels.

recSSc7Vujn4oBla0,“Metacogmission”: measuring metacognition across the lifespan and over two cognitive domains via an engaging gamified task,"Background:
Metacognition – or “thinking about your own thinking” – is of increasing interest to cognitive neuroscientists, as a concept with translational potential to real world problems including theories of mental illness, insight into mental health and the capacity for authentic decision-making. Open questions remain about how metacognition develops and functions. There is conflicting evidence about whether metacognition improves or decays with age, and whether it generalises across multiple cognitive domains. Measurement of metacognition has often been limited by confounding effects of an individual’s task performance levels and of their general propensity to be self-confident. Models derived from Type 2 signal-detection theory circumvent these issues by returning a metacognitive “efficiency” parameter, quantifying sensitivity of confidence ratings given a certain level of task performance. However, fitting these models requires high numbers of trials to generate robust parameters, making tasks difficult to use for people who have low concentration or motivation.

Methods:
Working with a technology firm and a mental health service user advisory group, we developed Metacogmission – a gamified metacognitive task. After trialling at 2 public engagement events with over 400 people, we here report a cross-sectional observational study of >300 online volunteers (18 to 83 years), measuring metacognition for memory and visual perception. We use Bayesian modelling to derive metacognitive efficiency (meta-d’/d’), charting metacognition through the lifespan across two domains. 

Results and conclusions:
Metacogmission was acceptable and fun, showing potential for use with clinical groups. Meta-d’ model fits, as assessed with MCMC convergence diagnostics, were robust, returning parameters comparable to those from more extensive laboratory tasks. Preliminary results indicate that as people age, performance on the first order cognitive tasks was preserved, although raw confidence (“bias”) decreased to middle age. Metacognitive efficiency remained largely stable with age, and was correlated across cognitive domains, consistent with a degree of domain-generality for metacognition.

If the surface touched is one’s own skin, a bump should also increase the pressure from the finger to the skin surface. Participants made two movements of the right hand while holding a haptic force-control robot. Resistances were added to both, and participants judged “which movement felt more bumpy; first or second?”. The movements were transferred to a second, slave robot, delivering but task-irrelevant stroking touch to the left forearm. The slave robot briefly increased or decreased tactile pressure in synchrony with right hand velocity decrease, consistent with encountering bumps, or holes respectively (blocked factor), during self-touch. We investigated whether left tactile events changes would bias judgement of the bump size perceived with the right hand. Left tactile pressure increases and decreases both increased bump size perceived by the right hand. Tactile information was thus transferred inter-hemispherically, but the sign of tactile information was not respected. In experiment 2, randomising (rather than blocking) tactile pressure increases/decreases abolished these biases. Inter-hemispheric transfer during self-touch is based on consistent models of synchronized events, but omits geometric object information.",Gaiqing Kong,"Gaiqing Kong, UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UK; Miruna Nitu, UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UK; Antonio Cataldo, Institute of Philosophy, University of London, UK; Hiroaki Gomi, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Japan; Patrick Haggard, UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UK.",Neuroscience Research Centre of Lyon INSERM U1028 ,"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-27 12:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 12:45:00+00:00,

We illustrate LiftPose3D’s versatility by applying it to multiple experimental systems using flies, mice, and macaque monkeys and in circumstances where 3D triangulation is impractical or impossible.

recSwsnVL0VM6Y3MQ,Collective response of oscillating neuronal population to the applied perturbation: a computational framework ,"Brain oscillations are hypothesized to modulate the inter-cortical communication and control the integration of information. The signal exchange in such processes relies on the response of the networks to the incoming inputs. Characterizing the network’s response with respect to the timing of input’s arrival, though, is crucial to assess the mechanism of cortical communication. In this study, we introduce a computational framework to investigate the collective response of a network regarding the perturbation phase at which it is received.


The role of inhibitory interneurons in generation of brain oscillations has firmly been established. Accordingly, we used a network of 500 inhibitory Integrate and Fire (IF) neurons and applied a brief perturbation to 10% of population at different phases of the LFP oscillation. The transient changes in the cycle period of subsequent oscillations as well as the change in their amplitudes are documented as a function of the perturbation phase. The resulted characteristic curve is called collective Phase (Amplitude) Response Curves (cPRC & cARC).


cPRC and cARC manifest, despite the fact that IF neuron models are type I and characterized by their phase only being advanced regardless of the phase of perturbation, a network consisting of IF neurons produces a delay in phase followed by an advance followed by a delay, depending on the timing of the perturbation. Furthermore, the amplitude of the subsequent cycle undergoes an increase-decrease-increase cycle of changes in its strength. The model then predicts that applying a perturbation at the early and very late phase of the oscillation gives rise to a transient reduction of LFP frequency while applying that at the middle period of oscillation induces a transient increment in that.


Our results suggest that the collective response of the oscillatory inhibitory networks are almost independent of the properties of the constituent neurons. As the collective response curve determine the efficacy of the communication and the signal exchange between the brain areas, this study can serve as an important step in understanding the mechanisms of inter-cortical communications.",Faeze Aminmansoor,"Alireza Valizadeh, Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS)",IPM,Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-27 13:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 13:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/Sn1CPfB3PgY
recSxjNWz11OSWfEM,Motor unit firing frequencies are muscle dependent during static contraction: importance of axon distance?,"          The somatic nervous system innervates hundreds of different striated muscles, each comprised of a sub-population of motor units (MU). For any voluntary muscle contraction (to remain static or move the joint) MU activation is required that first involves MU recruitment (i.e. spatial control) and subsequent firing rate modulation (i.e. temporal control) to enable precision in producing tension at the tendon. Because contractile output is affected by structural (fibre type, innervation ration, etc.) as well as synaptic (intrinsic and extrinsic) properties, our aim was to understand which structural factor is most probable to affect the observation of different MU firing frequencies among muscles. Thus, we generated four hypotheses based on: fibre type, innervation type (brainstem vs. spinal), axon distance and anatomical location.
           From an aggregated dataset containing MU firing rates from 15 different muscles and thousands of MU samples from male and female adult participants, post-hoc statistical comparisons were made based on the probability of an observed model (alternative) residing within a simulated distribution of model outputs (null distribution). For each hypothesis test, the simulated distribution was based on a fitted y-intercept with the addition of bootstrapping from studentized residuals of the observed model. We then performed 100 iterations of case bootstrapping for each hypothesis. Statistical significance was determined by a two-sided p-value calculation, where the observed slope coefficient (from the alternative) acted as the alpha value against the simulated distribution estimate. 
          Of the four hypotheses, axon distance to the muscle was the most probable hypothesis to reject the null estimate (q-value < 0.005). Therefore, axon distance as a factor to effect firing rates among muscles was least likely in our dataset to occur by chance, and we speculate that important axon-dependent structures related to internode length and maximum conduction velocity act as important limits on firing rate distributions.

Such a differentiation between self and other might seem trivial, but becomes more puzzling considering that many physiological responses and neural activations are shared between experiencing and observing of emotions. One proposed mechanism in which our sense of self might be anchored is the neural monitoring of heartbeats. The debate on how our emotional experiences are shaped by bodily signals, in particular cardiac signals, is long-standing, yet  this relationship has been mostly explored in how emotions might change cardiac activity. Here, we propose a new avenue of research; how is the neural monitoring of heartbeats related to our emotional experience, and more specifically, does the neural monitoring of heartbeats help differentiate self from other in emotion? To explore this question, participants engaged in an emotional perspective taking task while their brain activity was measured using EEG, and several peripheral physiological measures were recorded (cardiac activity, facial EMG, and Skin Conductance Responses (SCR)). While participants prepared to rate a naturalistic image for either their own emotion or the emotion depicted in the image, Heartbeat Evoked Responses (HER) significantly differed between the self and other condition. Additionally, during exploration of the image, a self-other difference in SCR was found, as well as an interaction for the valence of the image and self-other condition in the facial zygomatic muscle. Observed self-other HER differences were localized to frontal and occipital sources, which correlated with subjective ratings of the images, as well as empathic traits, but not with the effects observed in physiological responses.

Due to the heterogeneous nature of autism, treatment will likely only ameliorate symptoms in a subset of patients. There is a need to simultaneously test promising new compounds while understanding and predicting which patients will respond to each therapy. To determine what might contribute to response susceptibility, we propose the implementation of co-clinical trials in autism. In co-clinical trials, novel compounds, with established safety profiles, are simultaneously tested in mouse models of autism as well as in Phase 2 trials in humans with autism. A high-throughput protocol for mouse models of autism is discussed, which encompasses chronic treatment over development, multiple magnetic resonance imaging time-points, and behavioural tests before, during, and after treatment. Human subjects also follow an extensive phenotyping protocol, including behavioural testing, as well as genetics and imaging assessments. This multi-modal, multi-species approach is designed to be a rigorous method of assessing treatment effect, with the intention of stratification by response susceptibility. The considerations of the co-clinical trials is discussed, focusing on the trials and tribulations of the model, as well as lessons-learned.

However, this cueing effect changes according to the cue-to-target delay: short delays lead to faster responses in cued locations (RT Facilitation), while delays that are only slightly longer inverse this pattern and lead to faster responses to uncued locations (IOR). A method with high temporal resolution is required to study the neural correlates of these fast and dynamic processes. Here, data were recorded from 28 epileptic patients implanted with depth electrodes as a part of their medical treatment (1407 contacts), providing a unique opportunity to directly measure human neurophysiology with excellent spatio-temporal resolution. Patients performed the Posner paradigm with peripheral cues, while their neural responses were recorded. We studied the neural activity through a data-driven clustering approach, to reveal the spatiotemporal patterns of target-related activity. We identified specific neural clusters showing segregated cue and target related responses when the delay was long, but an integrated response to cue and target when the delay was short. Clusters varied in their sensitivity to the stimulus location, stimulus identity (cue or target) and response latency. These clusters may contribute to the computations underlying exogenous attention related effects.

recTYrzZUefunW2zx,The effects of cognitive and mechanical restrictions on modular neuromuscular control in younger and older adults during beam walking,"The manipulation of cognitive and mechanical restrictions affects performance and spatiotemporal parameters of gait. However, it is unclear if such restrictions also influence neuromuscular control of gait or whether age mediates their effect. Hence, we examined the effects of cognitive task and changes in arms position during beam walking in younger and older adults. Younger (YA, 23.8±3.2y, n=17) and older adults (OA, 69±3.9y, n=14) walked along a 6-cm wide beam (2-cm high, 4-m long), with free and chest folded arms, with and without a cognitive task (serial subtraction by 3). We used non-negative matrix factorization to extract muscle synergies from surface EMG recordings of 13 leg and trunk muscles. Differences in modular control complexity were assessed by comparing the number of muscle synergies (nsyn) and the variability accounted for by a single muscle synergy (VAF-1). The number of significantly active muscles per synergy (Wmus) and the sum of significantly active muscles per synergy (Wsum) were also compared to assess muscle coactivity and modular control efficiency. Addition of the cognitive task increased Wmus (without: 3.9±1.2, with: 4.4±1.3, p=0.047), only in YA, indicating increased coactivity in the presence of the subtractions in this group. On the other hand, restricting arm motion increased VAF-1 (folded: 74.5±3.7%, free: 73.2±4.2%, p=0.018), just in OA, suggesting less complexity of modular control with arms folded within older adults. Age was responsible for differences in nsyn (YA:7.0±1.3, OA:6.1±1.2, p=0.038), VAF-1 (YA:68.9±5.6%, OA:73.9±4.0%, p=0.004) and Wsum (YA: 2.1±0.5, OA: 2.5±0.7, p=0.034), implying less complexity and efficiency in modular control in OA. In conclusion, cognitive and mechanical restrictions affected neuromuscular control differently based on age, changing coactivity and complexity in YA and OA respectively. Older adults still exhibited a modular control strategy that was less complex and efficient than younger adults.

recTbt9Fer6FTIBB2,Age and stimulus type influence the association between multi-voxel threat representations and explicit memory during generalization,"Aberrations in threat generalization may contribute to childhood anxiety. However, few studies have examined threat generalization across development and no developmental studies have compared generalization gradients for social vs nonsocial threat. We used representational similarity analysis and fMRI to assess developmental differences in the association between neural threat representations and explicit memory across social and non-social stimuli.
Twenty adults (Mage = 25.8) and 16 youth (Mage = 14.1) completed one social and one nonsocial threat conditioning and extinction-recall paradigm. During conditioning, the social paradigm paired a woman’s face with a scream and the nonsocial paradigm paired a colored bell with an aversive alarm. Three weeks later, during extinction recall, participants viewed the threat cue (CS+), safety cue (CS-), and generalization stimuli consisting of CS-/CS+ blends. Multi-voxel BOLD patterns were measured in five ROIs (vmPFC, dmPFC, anterior insula, dACC, amygdala) and representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) were created for each subject in each ROI and condition. Individuals’ RDMs were correlated with memory ratings matrices, averaged within each age group and paradigm.
A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a Task x ROI x Age interaction, F(4,136) = 4.47, p = .002. Follow-up t-tests found a higher correlation between both youth and adults’ anterior insular activity patterns and memory ratings in the social than nonsocial task (ps < .002). Additionally, adults’ neural activity was more correlated with memory ratings for the social than nonsocial task in the dmPFC and vmPFC (ps < .004). Finally, youth’s dACC activity was more correlated with memory ratings for the social than nonsocial task, t(15) = 3.61, p = .003. 
These findings indicate that salience of social threats may contribute to greater correspondence between neural activity and memory ratings across age groups. Further, whereas adults may rely on PFC to make categorical distinctions between threat and safety, adolescents may engage salience network structures.",Dana Glenn,"Dana E.

recTe2dNEoXTE1jgO,3D Human Cortical Organoids to investigate developmental epileptic encephalopathies,"The human cerebral cortex is characterized by an extraordinary complexity of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types wired together for the execution of high-order cognitive functions. Alterations, during fetal development as well as after birth, in the assembly of cortical neuronal circuits can lead to aberrant neuronal activity and abnormal firing patterns, shared signs of neurodevelopmental disorders. Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathies (EIEE), a heterogeneous group of devastating childhood epilepsy disorders with a strong genetic component, constitute the most precocious syndromes that can affect infants as early as in the womb. EIEE mutations are associated with a variety of proteins implicated in a wide range of developmental processes, from neuronal migration and cell adhesion to transcriptional regulation and synaptic transmission (i.e. ARX, PCDH19, HCN1, FOXG1, SCN1A, GABAA). Despite the number of genes linked to EIEE is growing the etiology remains unknown for most cases, and it is challenging to decouple the patient-specific genetic make-up from the effect of the aberrant activity per se on brain development. To answer this fundamental question and address unique features of human development, we are exploiting a highly reproducible human cortical organoids (hCOs) system, on which we are inducing acute seizure-like currents, to model infantile/pediatric epilepsy in vitro. To address the implications of activity on circuit assembly, we aim to map at the single-cell level the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of treated and untreated hCOs, with the final goal of deciphering the epigenetic fingerprints produced by exacerbate activity in distinct classes of cortical neurons.

recTnCkmunGp6DTv9,Multidimensional analysis and detection of informative features in diffusion MRI measurements of human white matter,"Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to quantify tissue properties along the trajectories of white matter connections (Yeatman et al. 2012). Tractometry results are usually analyzed using mass univariate approaches, computed separately for each point along tracts (Colby et al. 2012), akin to fMRI voxel-wise analysis. Alternatively, an a priori hypothesis is used, where tissue properties are computed for a specific tract of interest. In the present work, we introduce a method based on the Sparse Group Lasso (SGL; Simon et al., 2013) that selects informative features by enforcing sparsity, both at the level of individual tracts and across the entire set of tracts, thereby recovering the minimal set of anatomical features to make accurate predictions. Our method presents a significant departure from previous analysis of tractometry data: rather than providing p-values for each individual location in the brain, the statistical accuracy of this method focuses on the accuracy of the predictions of phenotypic data.

We validated our approach in both regression and classification settings. An example dataset for classification contained data from 24 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 24 matched controls (Sarica et al. 2017). An example dataset for regression contained data from 76 healthy subjects, ranging between 6 years and 50 years of age and a validation dataset contained 641 healthy subjects from the Cam-CAN dataset. In the classification setting, we demonstrate that this method competes with previous results without the need for a priori feature engineering. Moreover, it automatically identifies well-known features of the disease. In the regression setting, the data can be used to accurately predict ""brain age"". Thus, this multivariate approach both (a) achieves high cross-validated accuracy for precision medicine applications of dMRI data and (b) identifies relevant features of brain anatomy to further our neuroscientific understanding of clinical disorders.",Adam Richie-Halford,"Jason Yeatman, Stanford University; Noah Simon, University of Washington; Ariel Rokem, University of Washington",University of Washington (grid.34477.33),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-29 21:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 21:45:00+00:00,
recTpey1dfjVdRWx0,Surprise signals in Frontal Eye Field,"In classic learning theory, surprise is quantified by unsigned prediction error, which determines how much attention is captured by a particular event. Unlike signed reward prediction error, an unsigned prediction error increases with the improbability of an outcome, regardless of its valence. Neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF) are sensitive to reward amount and are involved in the allocation of attention but it is unknown how they respond to surprising outcomes. To address this, we trained  monkeys in a Pavlovian paradigm requiring them to view two images in a probablistic sequence followed by delivery of a reward.  The leading image, depending on its identity, predicted with high probability (p = 0.83) delivery of either a large or a small reward at the end of the trial. The trailing image indicated with certainty that the ensuing reward would be either large or small. The information conveyed by the trailing image usually confirmed, but occasionally violated, the prediction conveyed by the leading image. The key question of the study is whether a given trailing image would elicit differential activity depending on whether it confirmed or violated the expectation created by the leading image. We found that the strength of the response to the trailing image was indeed influenced by surprise. Neurons responded more strongly to a trailing image predicting large reward when the probability of large reward was low than when it was high. Similarly, neurons responded more strongly to a trailing image predicting small reward when the probability of small reward was low than when it was high. Further, we demonstrate that these results depend on presenting the cues in rather than opposite the response field. The results are consistent with the interpretation that cues signaling surprising outcomes capture spatial attention and, in so doing, recruit excitation of FEF neurons.",Michael Shteyn (he/him),"Carl R.

recTsMb6JZuiYusEW,Critical behavior in networks of inhibitory-excitatory spiking neurons with weak synaptic efficacy,"Cortical circuits exhibit a rich dynamical behavior with irregular individual neuron firing rates, global oscillations, synchronization, scale-free fluctuations and high sensitivity to certain stimuli. While classical theories of inhibitory and excitatory (IE) neurons explain these behaviors, they require different synaptic properties. The coexistence of the observed behaviors suggests that the network may be operating at a near-critical regime. A recent study by Girardi-Schappo et. al. portrayed the phase space of IE neurons with binary activation, discrete-time dynamics, and stochastic threshold. The binary model presents qualitatively similar states to those of IE spiking neurons and the authors identified a critical point of the Direct Percolation (DP) universality class, namely a transition between an absorbing and an active network state often associated with a critical branching process. However, the existence and nature of the critical point in the case of more realistic spiking dynamics are still at question. In this work, we return the leaky iterate-and-fire (LIF) model, which was studies in the context of IE networks. We study its mean-field dynamics around the proposed critical point. When the total synaptic efficacy is of the order of the threshold -- a limit not previously studied -- stable activity with slow oscillations persists well into the unstable excitatory regime. This slow-oscillations phase is bounded by SNIC and Hopf bifurcation lines which meet at the proposed critical point. We find that along the Hopf bifurcation, the system exhibits scale-free avalanches with sub-critical scaling exponents that conform with in vivo cortical slice preparations. Importantly, we show that the microscopic dynamics cannot be understood as a critical-branching process.

recTylExYkV9Tuxb6,Predictive processing by Purkinje cells in the anterior vermis during active versus passive self-motion,"The ability to distinguish between self-generated (reafference) vs. externally-applied
(exafference) sensory signals is fundamental for ensuring accurate motor control. This is
particularly evident in the context of the vestibular system, in which the same neurons that
receive afferent input also mediate vestibulo-spinal reflexes (VSR). Notably, while VSRs are
essential for postural stability, they can be counterproductive during active motion. Previous
studies by our group have shown that VSR neurons selectively code passive head movements.
Although, the cerebellum is hypothesized to play a role in vestibular reafference suppression,
the exact underlying neural mechanism is unknown. Accordingly, here we recorded from
Purkinje cells in the anterior vermis of the vestibular cerebellum in rhesus monkeys during
passive and active motion. We first recorded neuronal responses to vestibular-only and neck
proprioceptive-only passive stimulation. Simple spike activity encoded both stimuli in a direction-
dependent manner. We then passively applied both vestibular and proprioceptive stimuli
simultaneously (i.e., passive head-on-body rotations) and found that Purkinje cells linearly
integrated these two inputs. However, comparison of neuronal responses to active and passive
head-on-body motion revealed a marked response attenuation for active head motion (~70%,
p<0.01). Accordingly, we next tested whether motor inputs to the Purkinje cells might mediate
the suppression observed during active movements. Most cells receive and encode motor
signals, yet a linear model could not explain response attenuation during active movements.
Finally, we compared the climbing fiber inputs to the Purkinje cells for passive vs. active head
movements and found that the probability of a complex spike firing increased (~60%, p<0.01)
immediately following (~20ms) the onset of passive but not active head movements, suggesting
that complex spikes detect externally-applied versus self-generated vestibular inputs. Taken
together, these results provide new insights into the cerebellar computations performed to
suppress the sensory consequences of self-generated movement to ensure postural stability.",Omid Zobeiri,Kathleen Cullen,McGill University (grid.14709.3b),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 12:00:00+00:00,2020-10-30 12:15:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/aGdqjyVM5_A
recU0f3I8Hd0Z0Ux0,Identifying Human Postural Dynamics and Control from Unperturbed Balance,"Upright standing requires control of an inherently unstable multi-joint human body within a small base of support, despite biological motor and / or sensory noise which challenge balance. Without applying perturbations, system identification methods have been regarded as inadequate, because the relevant internal biological noise processes are not accessible to direct measurement. As a result, unperturbed balance studies have been limited to investigation of subjects' behavioral response patterns rather than possible underlying control strategies.
 In this work, we present a mathematically rigorous system identification method that is applicable to study the dynamics and control of unperturbed balance. The method is derived from autocorrelation matrices with non-zero time lags and identifies the system matrix of a discrete-time dynamic system in the presence of unknown noise processes, without requiring any information about the strength of the noise.  
Unlike reasonable `least-squares' approaches, the performance of the new method is consistent across a range of different combinations of internal and measurement noise strengths, even when measurement noise is substantial. We present a numerical example of a model that simulates human upright balancing and show that its dynamics can be identified accurately. With a biomechanically reasonable choice of state and input variables, a state feedback controller can also be identified. 
Our numerical results indicate that the system identification method proposed in this work is applicable to real-world experimental data. Using this method, the dynamics and control of human quiet standing can be studied in depth without concern for adaptation or possible reflex responses evoked by external perturbations, or any need for expensive high-precision measurement equipment. This may enable diagnosis and treatment of individual subjects with impaired balance, and the development of safe and effective assistive and / or rehabilitative technologies.

Assessment of heritability of different cognitive, behavioral traits and brain features is a key to this age-old debate. Heritability characterizes the proportion of variation in a given trait within a population that is not explained by the environmental or stochastic events. Recent studies have investigated heritability of complex brain features, including brain shape and connectivity of different brain regions (connectomes). We introduce a dissimilarity metric between a pair of connectomes that is based on statistical network models to assess heritability of human connectomes. Using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data, we computed the dissimilarity in all pairs of monozygotic, dizygotic, siblings, and unrelated individuals. We show that the distributions of dissimilarity among the four groups are significantly different and are stochastic ordered, from smallest to greatest dissimilarity: monozygotic, dizygotic, siblings and unrelated pairs. Thus, we confirm that structurally-derived estimates of human connectomes are heritable.

By recording from large ensembles of hippocampal neurons as rats explored novel and familiar linear tracks in various experiments, we found that hippocampal replays appear after a single experience and slow down with subsequent experience as greater detail is incorporated. We also investigated hover-and-jump dynamics within replays that are associated with the slow gamma (25-50Hz) oscillation in the LFP and found that replays slow down by adding more hover locations, corresponding to depiction of the behavioral trajectory with increased resolution.

recUYSJQXRdHNnDQh,Microstimulation and optogenetics: A combined stimulation strategy,"It has been well studied that intracortical microstimulation is sufficient to drive action potential generation in cortical neurons of awake behaving animals. However, in certain sensory regions of the brain, microstimulation is difficult to implement due to the overlap of functional regions covered by the spreading electrical current. In the primary somatosensory cortex for example, neurons representing features of tactile perception such as motion or texture are intermixed in functional circuits at the cellular level. Therefore, microstimulation of these regions can lead to the activation of multiple feature-encoding neurons simultaneously, which limits the ability of microstimulation to drive functional haptic perception. In contrast to ICMS, optogenetics is a technique capable of driving units with single-cell precision for both activation (channelrhodopsin) and inactivation (halorhodopsin). Optogenetics however requires direct exposure to light and therefore is limited in spatial depth and reach. The goal of this project is to reduce the ambiguity of artificial sensations by implementing a combined strategy of microstimulation and optogenetics to selectively silence cells activated by microstimulation using a biologically constrained model. A biologically constrained computational model was constructed in MATLab to analyze the population responses to electrical and optogenetic stimuli. The individual current and luminous intensity contributions are summated and included in a Poisson spiking model to determine neural activation. To test our predictions, we first analyzed how a single optoelectrode affects the neural sets within the population. This analysis was expanded to include the interaction of multiple optoelectrodes within the subspace to achieve a desired stimulation pattern.

recUc9qT5pEcvLh6B,Finger stability in precision grips,"Stable precision grips underlie human hand dexterity. However, multi-link chains like our fingers are inherently prone to the mechanical instability of buckling, where the finger snaps into a hyper-extended posture when applying tip forces. How the neuromuscular control suppresses buckling instabilities in healthy fingers remains unknown. Using experiments and mathematical modeling, we show that human fingers maintain stability by using an open-loop strategy based on muscle stiffness, rather than sensorimotor feedback. In an experiment, we instructed people to maximize their index fingertip's forces in self-selected postures. The occasional buckling events were too fast for neural feedback control to stabilize, suggesting that stable finger postures rely on muscle stiffness. However, using a biomechanical model of the index finger activated by seven muscles, we found that muscle stiffness is also insufficient for stable grips at maximal forces unless we add extra stiffness to stabilize the finger joints. We tested this prediction in 23 subjects. Attaching a stiffening splint to the finger increased the maximal force by 69±14% and total muscle electromyography readings from two flexors by 85±23% compared to the finger without splint (mean±standard error). Therefore, people do not apply their true maximal force unless extra stiffness allows their muscles to apply higher force without compromising stability. We calculated the viable space of muscle activities that satisfy the finger's equilibrium and stability constraints using the biomechanical model. The viable activation patterns lie within a six-dimensional convex hyperplane that is embedded in the seven-dimensional space of normalized muscle activations. Within this viable space, muscle co-contraction could stabilize submaximal but not maximal forces. More stiffness aids stability but compromises compliance, essential for the adaptive grasping of complex objects geometries.

Moreover, recent work in animals shows that the SN/VTA does not only process rewarding but also aversive events. However, direct evidence from human subjects, which often learn through social interactions, is sparse. Therefore, we used intracranial electroencephalography recordings (iEEG) from SN dopamine (DA) neurons in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients (n=12, intraoperative, off medication) in combination with a social incentive delay task (SID) including photos of either neutral, approving or disapproving faces. At the behavioral level, patients’ response times did not differ between conditions. Healthy controls (young adults n=51; older adults n=52) and a slightly larger control group of PD patients (n = 19, on and off medication) exposed faster responses when anticipating positive and negative versus neutral feedback. Finally, time-frequency analysis revealed an effect within the alpha-beta range (8-20 Hz) from 300-600 ms after cue onset. Specifically, alpha-beta power significantly increased for positive vs neutral and negative vs neutral cues, but there was no significant difference between positive vs negative cues.

How cross-regional interactions reorganize during learning remains elusive. We applied multi-fiber photometry to chronically record simultaneous activity of 12-48 mouse brain regions while mice learned a tactile discrimination task. We found that with learning most regions shifted their peak activity from reward-related action to the reward-predicting stimulus. We corroborated this finding by functional connectivity estimation using transfer entropy, which revealed growth and stabilization of mesoscale networks encompassing basal ganglia, thalamus, cortex, and hippocampus, especially during stimulus presentation. The internal globus pallidus, ventromedial thalamus, and several regions in frontal cortex emerged as hub regions.

However, much of the existing research surrounding aesthetic preferences does not consider the impact of such changes. Understanding how and why our preferences may change over time is important not only for fields such as neuroaesthetics, marketing, and neuroeconomics, but for cognitive sciences overall. Here, we investigated how aesthetic preferences for different colored shirts, cars, and phone cases changed over a 4-week period. We measured changes in preferences for these three categories on a weekly basis. Our results showed that aesthetic preferences tended to drift further from their initial starting point as time went on. This effect was consistent for all three categories. We further found that aesthetic stability tended to increase as a function of age, but did not differ across sex. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate aesthetic preferences across multiple timepoints as well as categories. Our findings show that aesthetic preferences are not stable even at a weekly interval, stressing the importance of understanding how these changes may be reflected in existing experiments as well as in other domains of cognitive science.",Hassan Aleem,,Georgetown University (grid.213910.8),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-26 16:15:00+00:00,2020-10-26 16:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/nRrMg9F4mFc
recUuUKbLFgU6XvcC,Effects of practice of meditation on Brain EEG dynamics,"Background: Humanity is going through unprecedented challenges. Chronic lifestyle diseases and mental health issues have skyrocketed in the last few decades, posing a significant threat to human well-being. Ancient Indian mind and body practices like Yoga and meditation prove beneficial in these times.

Aims: To assess the effects of the practice of Isha Yoga on the Brain using EEG

Methods: EEG data was acquired using a 128-channel Geodesic EEG system, in 7 advanced meditators, 5 novice meditators, and 6 controls (those with no previous history of any meditation). EEG data was recorded in all the three groups for 62 minutes (4 mins rest – 30 mins cognitive task – 4 mins rest – 6 mins of Pranayama – 14 mins of meditation – 4 mins of rest). EEG data preprocessing was done using Makoto’s PREP pipeline in EEGLAB v13.4.4b and MATLAB version R2017a.

Results: There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05 with FDR correction) in power spectral plots between the three groups: For Pranayama at 6 – 8 Hz (frontal mid-line and occipital regions) and 30 – 40 Hz (fronto-parietal and occipital regions); For Meditation at 6 – 8 Hz (occipital regions) and 30 – 40 Hz (Frontal and occipital regions)

Conclusion: Advanced practitioners of Isha Yoga had an increased frontal mid-line theta power (indicating greater parasympathetic activation and calmness) and an increased gamma wave power (indicating brain-wide synchronization and a high degree of attentional control). The results indicate that the long-term practice of Isha Yoga leads to greater well-being and higher cognitive control.

recUv1wJUwHLo8Ho8,How the Mind Creates Structure: Hierarchical Learning of Complex Action Sequences,"Humans have the astonishing ability to learn from small amounts of data in reward-sparse environments, and to efficiently create multi-step goal-directed action plans. How humans aquire the representations that support this ability has fascinated researchers in psychology and artiﬁcial intelligence for decades. We investigate the contributions of two mechanisms: curiosity, the intrinsic motivation to explore the effects actions have on the environment; and hierarchical structure, the representation of goals and actions across multiple levels of abstraction.
To test this hypothesis, we asked 60 undergraduate participants (49 females) to participate in a task in which they operated a star-making machine using their computer keyboard, with the goal of collecting as many stars as possible. 
Participants needed to learn four 4-key sequences that led to 4 different stars. Each 4-key sequence was made up of two successive 2-key sequences. The 2-key sequences were one of four possible shared across stars, and their successful execution was signaled visually (triggering curiosity), but not rewarded. We asked whether participants learned and employed this underlying structure to obtain stars. Indeed, response time (RT) patterns revealed a strong segmentation of participants’ 4-key sequences into two 2-key sequences, with markedly speeded RTs on actions 2 and 4 of the sequence, compared to actions 1 and 3. This suggests that participants learned the 2-key sequences and used them as a basis to explore 4-key sequences. The strength of RT segmentation was related to performance, such that high levels of segmentation—suggesting exploration in the space of 2-key sequences—was related to faster learning. After learning, participants underwent an unsignaled transfer block, in which either 2-key sequences were modified by exchanging component keys (low-level transfer), or 4-key sequences were modified by exchanging component 2-key sequences (high-level transfer). Participants showed faster relearning after high-level than low-level transfer, suggesting that high-level policies were more malleable and low-level policies were more automated. 
This research sheds light on the cognitive processes involved in representation learning for decision making. Faced with the natural world’s combinatorial explosion of possibilities, humans might bootstrap learning by shifting the level of exploration from basic actions to compound action sequences, which are themselves learned through curiosity.",Maria Eckstein,Anne CE Collins,"University of California, Berkeley (grid.47840.3f)","Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 17:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 17:15:00+00:00,
recUvvLKOTfQqTYcU,Evaluation of Anti-Parkinson’s activity of Herbomineral (Abhrak bhasma) on Rotenone induced Parkinson’s disease in Drosophila melanogaster.,"Background and rationale: The study was designed to validate the claims in Ayurveda regarding the efficacy of Ayurvedic drugs in neurodegenerative disorders. It was decided to conduct an efficacy study of a herbomineral drug (Abhrak bhasma) on Parkinson’s disease induced chemically in Drosophila melanogaster (fly). Parkinson’s disease has symptom descriptions in Ayurveda and modern medicine. The latter offers only the symptomatic therapy by replacing dopamine, the neurotransmitter involved, but does not slow down or reverse the loss of dopaminergic neurons.
Methods: Rotenone, in a final concentration of 125 μM, was induced for inducing Parkinson’s disease in Drosophila melanogaster. Table concentration of bhasma samples were selected on the basis of viability assays carried out in our lab. The group serving as negative control will not have the study drugs in the cornmeal medium and the flies from positive control will be fed with L-dopa dissolved in the medium in the concentration of 1 mM. The flies in the bottle will be maintained for a period of 7 days at 25OC. On the 8th day, they will be subjected to climbing assay. The brain tissue of Drosophila melanogaster will be dissected and be subjected to biochemical estimations- Malondialdehyde, Glutathione, Protein estimation and Dopamine estimation.
Results: Climbing assays showed a significant reduction in the climbing/ motor ability between the contrel and disease control groups. There was a significant improvement in the climbing ability of flies fed with l-dopa and study drugs. Inflammatory markers and Dopamine levels were improved in the group fed with the drug. 
Conclusion:  Herbomineral (Abhrak bhasma) were found to be effective in reducing the rotenone induced dopaminergic loss of neurons.

recV0JNTZyv5ptIer,Transthyretin and Alzheimer’s disease: Systematic review,"Introduction:
Prealbumin or transthyretin (TTR), a protein, is found in various tissues, including the brain. [1]
Studies have found a conflicting role of TTR in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). [1-3]
No systematic review, the highest quality of evidence, currently exists on this. Only narrative reviews exist.

 Material and methods:
1. We conducted the systematic review as per the PRISMA checklist and flowchart
We conducted a search on PUBMED/ MEDLINE database on 15th June 2020.
2. We used the search function: ((transthyretin) OR (prealbumin)) AND (Alzheimer's disease)
3. We found 95 eligible studies after the three steps of screening.
Identification: Records identified through database searching (PUBMED) (n=346). Additional records identified through other sources (n=0). Duplicate Removal: Records after duplicates removed (n=346).
Screening:
  Records screened (n = 346), Records excluded (n=184).
  Full-text articles assessed for eligibility (n =162). Full-text articles excluded, with reasons (n=67).
Included- Studies included in qualitative synthesis (n=95).

Results:
Majority of studies find that TTR has an overall neuroprotective role in AD.
TTR has been found to clear Amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide molecules and inhibit Aβ aggregation.
TTR is found to influence A-beta levels in a gender-specific manner, its action influenced by testosterone and estradiol.
There is enough evidence to suggest that TTR in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) comes from 3 sources: (1) synthesis by neurons, (2) synthesis by choroid plexus; and (3) serum TTR also diffuses into the CSF.
Studies done in CSF report that TTR levels in CSF are significantly decreased in AD.
In CSF of patients with AD, abundant oxidized iOS forms of TTR are detected.
Studies done in serum also find that TTR levels inversely correlate with disease progression. Serum TTR levels are found to be lowered in AD patients.
Serum levels of TTR have been found to be a good biomarker for AD for diagnostics.

Discussion:
We could not perform quantitative synthesis due to lack of large observational or interventional studies in clinical practice.
We only searched the PUBMED/MEDLINE database, and did not utilise SCOPUS or EMBASE.

recV2BxxtamxtFmZr,Permutation-corrected independence testing for high-dimensional fMRI data,"Making comparisons between populations of brain scans is a difficult task given the high dimensionality of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Distance correlation statistics are well suited to performing 2-sample tests in the high-dimensional setting, which have a wide range of applications including such fMRI data. However, the common assumption of exchangeability among samples, or equivalence of distribution, under the 2-sample null distribution cannot be made if there are multiple subjects each with multiple scans, as is often the case. If naively performed, distance correlation can yield significant p-values solely due to these known, unaccounted for dependencies. We develop a multi-level generalization of distance correlation to k-sample testing which accounts for the presence of known dependencies by restricting the space of possible permutations. We evaluate this method on a novel data set of expert and novice meditators each with fMRI measurements during rest and during two different meditative states. The measurements are taken over cortical vertices and cortical gradients are extracted using diffusion map embeddings. The results show patterns of differentiability between certain pairs of states in certain levels of expertise and avoid false positives that would have been seen without appropriate corrections.

recV2QqENoB6JvpiE,When the ventral visual stream is not enough: A deep learning account of medial temporal lobe involvement in perception,"The medial temporal lobe (MTL) supports a constellation of memory-related behaviors. Its involvement in perceptual processing, however, has been subject to an enduring debate. This debate centers on perirhinal cortex (PRC), an MTL structure at the apex of the ventral visual stream (VVS), beset by decades of seemingly inconsistent experimental outcomes. We suggest that these apparent inconsistencies can be resolved by situating experimental behavior in relation to perceptual processing supported by the VVS. To evaluate this claim we leverage a deep learning approach that approximates visual behaviors supported by the VVS. We first apply this approach retroactively, modeling 29 published concurrent visual discrimination experiments: Excluding misclassified stimuli, there is a striking correspondence between a computational proxy for the VVS and PRC-lesioned behavior. Conversely, PRC-intact subjects outperform this model and PRC-lesioned subjects. We corroborate these results using novel, high-throughput psychophysics experiments: PRC-intact participants outperform a linear readout of electrophysiological recordings from the macaque VVS. Finally, in silico experiments suggest PRC enables out-of-distribution visual behaviors at rapid timescales: VVS-like models achieve PRC-dependent accuracy, but only with extensive training, while failing to generalize to out-of-sample stimuli. By situating these lesion, electrophysiological, and behavioral results within a shared computational framework, our work resolves decades of seemingly inconsistent experimental findings surrounding PRC involvement in perception. In doing so, we have identified biologically constraints that may inform future models of human-level visual behaviors.",tyler bonnen,"Daniel L.K. Yamins, Stanford Universiry; Anthony D.

recVHJNnY6ltNeHu2,Embryonic Neuronal Activity in the Circuit Assembly of the Mouse Piriform Cortex,"Throughout development, neuronal activity plays a vital role in the assembly of neuronal circuits. While this has been explored in many afferent sensory circuits, the role of activity in shaping recurrent intracortical networks remains largely unexplored. The mouse piriform cortex is an interesting region to study this as it contains highly recurrently connected neuronal assemblies which respond to different olfactory stimuli. While the time and mechanism of the development of these assemblies is unclear, there is much evidence suggesting neonatal mice have olfactory learning capability at birth and require olfaction to survive. Given the potential ethological importance of these assemblies in early development, the perinatal maturation of these assemblies may elucidate principles of activity-dependent formation of recurrent intracortical circuits.

Using genetic techniques to label active neurons in the developing mouse brain, I found that the piriform cortex is one of the only cerebral cortical regions that is robustly active in late embryogenesis. I propose this embryonic neuronal activity may shape piriform assembly maturation in utero, which may in turn facilitate neonatal olfactory learning and behavior. One possible mechanism is that synchronized in utero activity of piriform neurons may strengthen assembly connectivity through Hebbian plasticity, and well-connected assemblies may promote robust pattern completion to facilitate neonatal olfactory learning. To explore this, I am probing the role of these embryonically labeled piriform neurons with immediate-early gene labeling and neonatal behavior, and the physiological connectivity of assemblies with optogenetics and whole-cell recordings in acute neonatal brain slices.",David Wang,"David C.

recVHNzXDx6wrvKZM,Offline memory replay in recurrent spiking neuronal networks,"When foraging for food, rodents rapidly store memories of sequences of events including visual and sensory landmarks and behavioral choices, often based on a single experience. In parallel with behavioral learning, pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus rapidly acquire selectivity for ""snippets of the animal's experience"", including selectivity for spatial positions explored in the environment (a.k.a. ""place fields”). We recently showed that a special event in the dendrites of pyramidal cells called a dendritic plateau potential can induce bidirectional synaptic plasticity to rapidly shift the location of a cell's place field in a single trial. Interestingly, this rapid plasticity also results in recruitment of these neurons to fire during hippocampal sharp wave/ripple events, which occur during ""offline"" resting periods, and often feature temporally compressed firing of neurons in the same sequential order that occurred during ""online"" exploration of the environment. Here we explore the circuit mechanisms of offline memory replay in a recurrent spiking neuronal network model. We tuned a simple network model with an architecture similar to hippocampal area CA3 to exhibit physiological levels of sparsity, selectivity, and rhythmicity, and found that this network can be cued by random input to emit sequences of neuronal firing resembling offline memory replay events.",Aaron Milstein,"Sarah Tran, Stanford University; Grace Ng, Stanford University; Ivan Soltesz, Stanford University","Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (grid.430387.b)","Theme B: Neural Excitability, Synapses, and Glia",Traditional talk,2020-10-27 18:15:00+00:00,2020-10-27 18:30:00+00:00,
recVICGE6ZbXgWlGH,How representations adapt: the role of structure in model-based planning ,"Updating a model of the world that is used for planning faces a trade-off between computational efficiency (generalisation across different contexts) on the one hand and context-specific encoding on the other. Humans are exceptionally good at navigating this trade-off, though the neural implementation of this balance remains elusive. We developed a two-stage sequential learning task which allowed us to probe human state transition probability learning across two sets of contexts. One set (dependent blocks) involved two contexts with identical transition probabilities whereas the other set (independent blocks) consisted of two contexts with uncorrelated transition probabilities. We find that participants collapse across contexts in the dependent but not the independent set of contexts, using information from both contexts to inform choices when adaptive, which is confirmed by our computational modelling.  Comparing the neural (fMRI) encoding of model-derived state transition functions and updating between the two contexts in each set allowed us to investigate where in the brain this selective combination or separation of representations is implemented.  Using representational similarity analysis, we find that the pattern of neural activity associated with using and updating transition functions is more similar between contexts in dependent than in independent blocks in parts of the hippocampal formation (including parts of amygdala and entorhinal cortex). This suggests that, in line with recent theoretical proposals, the hippocampus and surrounding structures may be the parts of the brain that allow for an adaptive degree of generalisation and separation of environmental information, enabling us to both plan and learn from experience.

This process is believed to provide a cellular substrate for spatial navigation. Growing evidence designate astrocytes, the most abundant non-neural cell type in the brain, as circuital elements involved in the processing of sensory information in several brain circuits. However, whether spatial information is exclusively encoded in neuronal hippocampal network or rather encoded in an extended circuit involving also astroglial elements is unknown. Here, we explore the hypothesis that astrocytes encode navigational information in their intracellular calcium dynamics, a major form of cellular signaling in this type of glial cell. To these aims, we trained head-tethered mice to navigate in a virtual linear track and we recorded calcium signals during virtual spatial navigation combining cell-specific expression of genetically encoded calcium indicators with two-photon functional imaging. We found that astrocytic calcium activity was significantly and reliably modulated by the animal’s spatial position in the virtual track. Calcium events accumulated at preferred locations of the virtual track and this phenomenon occurred in subcellular regions of the astrocyte, including the cell soma and proximal processes. Importantly, using a support vector machine classifier, we found that astrocytic calcium signals carried significant single-trial information about the animal’s spatial location. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that non only neurons, but also astroglial networks, carry information about external variables important for performing complex cognitive tasks such as spatial navigation.",Sebastiano Curreli,"Jacopo Bonato, Neural Coding Laboratory Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia Genova and Rovereto Italy - Neural Computation Laboratory Center for Neuroscience and Cognitive Systems @UniTn - Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology University of Bologna Italy; Sara Romanzi, Optical Approaches to Brain Function Laboratory Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia Genova Italy - Neural Coding Laboratory Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia Genova and Rovereto Italy; Stefano Panzeri, Neural Coding Laboratory Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia Genova and Rovereto Italy - Neural Computation Laboratory Center for Neuroscience and Cognitive Systems @UniTn Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia Rovereto Italy; Tommaso Fellin, Optical Approaches to Brain Function Laboratory Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia Genova Italy - Neural Coding Laboratory Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia Genova and Rovereto Italy;",Italian Institute of Technology (grid.25786.3e),"Theme B: Neural Excitability, Synapses, and Glia",Traditional talk,2020-10-28 08:15:00+00:00,2020-10-28 08:30:00+00:00,
recVPj9cxBVDSKmiR,Action imitation via trajectory-based or posture-based planning,"Movement imitation is a significant daily activity involved in social interaction and motor learning. Although imitation remains poorly understood, recent research suggests that it may be achieved in two distinct ways. In posture-based imitation, movements reproduce how the body should look and feel, and are sensitive to the relative positioning of body parts. In trajectory imitation, movements mimic the spatiotemporal motion path of the end effector. We hypothesized that people can imitate via either mechanism. If true, we would expect to see a switch cost when individuals change from one mechanism to the other. To test this, twenty-five healthy young adults performed a sequential multitasking imitation task. Participants were first instructed to pay attention to the limb postures or the hand path of a video-recorded model. They next performed an intervening motor task that was neutral, congruent, or incongruent with the instructed imitation type. Finally, participants imitated the modeled movement. Spatiotemporal imitation accuracy was greatest after a neutral intervening task, and worst after posture matching. When the primary task involved imitating trajectories, we observed a switch cost: movements following the posture-matching intervening task were less consistent with baseline (neutral) performance, suggesting performance was disrupted by the incongruence. Incongruent primary and intervening tasks also reduced cross-subject consistency. Such effects were not observed when imitating limb postures. In summary, we observed a partial dissociation between posture matching and trajectory imitation as a result of instructions and intervening tasks that is nevertheless consistent with the existence of two computationally distinct imitation mechanisms.

recVVwkh9T36BVdsI,Using topological data analysis to investigate the relationship between population gut microbiome and Parkinson's Disease,"Neurological disorders are the leading global cause of disability, and Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the fastest growing of them. Thus, finding disease-modifying treatments for this debilitating disorder is becoming ever more pressing. Increasing evidence from animal and human studies points to a central role of gut dysbiosis in contributing to PD pathology, a potential target for novel therapies. However, standard analyses cannot consider the complexity and non-linearity of the gut microbiome, likely missing many subtle relationships. This study is the first to use indirect association with PD on a population gut microbiome dataset, and additionally the first to use Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to analyse an association of the microbiome with disease. For this, countries in a large, open-access microbiome dataset (sample size N=1151) were grouped based on Years Lived with Disease (YLD). The study used TDA to analyse the network structure of the microbiome data and associate it with these disease groups (High or Low YLDs) and other host factors through network enrichment stratification. We found that the PD groups were associated with distinct clusters of the microbiome network, a pattern that covaried with certain phyla. Specifically, the High YLD group was associated with Bacteroidetes, while the Low YLD group was associated with Firmicutes, but also Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The latter two are hypothesised to relate to a lower burden of PD through their complex inverse relationship with Firmicutes, which are thought to be neuroprotective. Thus, TDA is a fruitful tool for microbiome analysis and has extended previous findings. Importantly, the study supports the microbiome as a promising candidate target for scalable novel intervention therapies, such as pre-, pro-, or antibiotics, among others.

Previous studies have used different measures associated with consciousness, with psychedelics to quantify and measure such altered states of consciousness (ASC) produced and its effect on consciousness. The present study investigated the effects of different stroboscopic stimulation frequencies (3, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 19 Hz) on neural dynamics, using measures such as signal diversity (Lempel-Ziv complexity) and spectral power measured using EEG and attempted to relate these changes to self-reported changes in experiential content. The results indicated the stimulation frequencies within and near the alpha band (8 – 12 Hz) caused the greatest increase across all tested neural measures, with 8 Hz consistently displaying the most pronounced results, relative to baseline. All tested frequencies led to an increase in all experiential dimensions, relative to baseline and produced subjective visual and experiential effects similar to those associated with psychedelics.  The results highlight the rich potential of using stroboscopic stimulation as a means of non-invasive neuromodulation.

recVr0Yo4nLIftrO2,"Astrocytes contribute to motor learning, neuronal correlations and movement encoding by motor cortex neurons ","While motor cortex is crucial for learning precise and reliable movements, whether and how astrocytes contribute to its plasticity and function during motor learning is unknown. Here we report that primary motor cortex (M1) astrocytes in mice show in vivo plasticity during learning of a lever push task, as revealed by transcriptomic and functional modifications, particularly changes in expression of glutamate transporter genes and increased coincidence of microdomain calcium events. Astrocyte-specific manipulations of M1 are sufficient to alter motor learning and execution, and neuronal population coding, in the same task. Specifically, mice expressing decreased levels of the astrocyte glutamate transporter GLT1 show impaired and variable movement trajectories. Mice with increased astrocyte Gq signaling show decreased performance rates, delayed response times and impaired trajectories, along with abnormally high levels of GLT1. In both groups of mice, M1 neurons have altered inter-neuronal correlations and impaired population representations of task parameters, including response time and movement trajectories. Thus, astrocytes have a specific role in coordinating M1 neuronal activity during motor learning, and control learned movement execution and dexterity through mechanisms that include fine regulation of glutamate transport.

For example, speech and music play a unique role in human hearing, yet it is unclear how their cortical representations differ between humans and other animals. In a previous study, we found that humans showed selectivity for natural vs. spectrotemporally-matched synthetic speech and music in non-primary regions, that both cannot be explained by lower-level modulation statistics, and do not yet reflect explicit semantic knowledge. Here, we addressed the question of whether such higher-order selectivity is present in other species. Precisely, we measured cortical responses in ferrets to the same set of natural and synthetic sounds previously tested in humans, as well as natural and synthetic ferret vocalizations, using functional Ultrasound imaging, a newly developed wide-field imaging technique. We found that tuning for spectrotemporal modulations present in both natural and synthetic sounds was similar between humans and ferrets, and could be quantitatively predicted across species, consistent with prior findings. But unlike humans, ferret responses to natural and synthetic sounds were similar throughout primary and non-primary auditory cortex even when comparing natural and synthetic ferret vocalizations; and the small differences that were present in ferrets were weak and spatially scattered. This finding reveals that auditory representations in humans and ferrets diverge sharply at late stages of cortical processing, potentially driven by higher-order processing demands in speech and music.",Agnès  Landemard,"Célian Bimbard, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology ;  Charlie Demené, Physics For Medecine; Shihab Shamma, Laboratoire des Systèmes Perceptifs; Sam Norman-Haigneré, Zuckerman Institute for Mind Brain Behavior ; Yves Boubenec, Laboratoire des Systèmes Perceptifs",Laboratoire des Systèmes Perceptifs (grid.463948.4),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 13:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 13:30:00+00:00,

The main symptom is memory loss but clinical evidence shows that olfactory dysfunction can occur years before any cognitive symptoms. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an important risk factor for AD development. Experimental research has shown that insulin resistance and oxidative stress (a core MS dysfunction) promote the amyloidogenic pathway, leading to the development of neuritic plaques characteristic of AD. Whether these alterations participate on olfactory dysfunction is still unknown. We evaluated olfactory and memory function, explored insulin pathway activation, amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, lipid peroxidation and neurodegenerative processes in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus using an MS model induced by a high carbohydrate diet. We found olfactory dysfunction in rats that ate a high carbohydrate diet, but interestingly memory appeared to be better in this group Systemic hyperinsulinemia hyper-activated the insulin pathway and APP was downregulated in the hippocampus. Nonetheless, these effects were not observed in the olfactory bulb, as insulin activation and APP expression remained unchanged. Malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker, was decreased in the hippocampus and unchanged in the olfactory bulb. We did not find neurodegeneration in these tissues. These results provide novel information about olfactory function in a model of MS induced by high carbohydrate.

recVvbU5XN2YTDaoj,On the generation of theta rhythms and theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling. ,"In the hippocampus, the 3-12 Hz local field potential (LFP) theta oscillation is a rhythm strongly correlated with spatial navigation, episodic memory and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. As such, understanding the origin of this rhythm could shed light on the emergence of such cognitive phenomena. However, how the large variety of inhibitory and excitatory cell types form a theta-generating network remains unknown. We use a previously published full CA1 hippocampus model of unprecedented biological detail to understand the generation mechanism of theta rhythms. The model contains eight morphologically detailed interneuron types and pyramidal cells and is constructed based on experimentally derived connectivity. We find that a 400 μm thick, isolated segment (slice) of this hippocampus model, represents the minimum network that can generate theta rhythms. Guided explorations of this computationally tractable model reveal that theta rhythms are initiated by the pyramidal cells but are regularized by inhibitory inputs from parvalbumin positive fast-firing cells, supporting an “inhibition-based tuning” mechanism. We find a strong correlation between the net input current to the pyramidal cells and the resulting theta frequency, inferring that the intrinsic pyramidal cell properties are theta frequency controllers. We next investigate the control of external input drives to the theta rhythms of the segment model, including the recently discovered inputs from the subiculum. Finally, we leverage our insights to explain the termination mechanism of theta bursts and the theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling in the original full CA1 model.  As modern pharmacological approaches focus on cellular and subcellular targets, our models can be used to identify cellular-specific pathways underlying changes in LFP theta/gamma rhythms.

Understanding how and why the brain can learn in such a sample efficient manner remains an open problem for neuroscience and artificial intelligence. In this work, we study how the structure of neural population codes influences the number of sampled stimuli required to learn an accurate linear readout. We find that sample efficient learning requires a population level inductive bias determined by the structure of the inner-product kernel, which measures the similarity of neural responses to two different input stimuli. We demonstrate that the eigendecomposition of the kernel provides information about the strength of the inductive bias as well as the compatibility of the population code with certain tasks. In a model of online learning, trial to trial variability (neural noise) can either facilitate or prevent rapid learning depending on the geometry of responses. We apply our theory of generalization to experimental population responses of mouse V1 neurons, showing how they have a good inductive bias for low frequency orientation discrimination tasks but do not possess an appropriate inductive bias to efficiently discriminate semantic categories of objects from linear readout.

recWFTOFCYw0WHP9q,Neural and genetic bases for human ability traits,"The understanding of human ability, including behavioral and neurological function, is still underexplored. Current attempts are often narrowly defined and lack a comprehensive basis. However, a better definition of a basis for human ability would be invaluable since neuropsychiatric disease diagnoses and symptom severity are commonly related to such differences in performance. Here, we use the framework of the  National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox, which provides a unified assessment of neurologic and behavioral function to identify four underlying ability traits within the NIH Toolbox normative data (n = 1369): 1: Motor-endurance, 2: Emotional processing, 3: Executive and cognitive function, and 4: Social interaction. Using the Human Connectome Project young adult dataset (n = 778) we showed that two traits, Motor-endurance and Executive and cognitive function were reliably associated with specific brain functional networks (r^2=0.305±0.021). Moreover, we showed the biological nature of these ability traits by calculating their heritability (31% and 49% respectively) from twin data.
Therefore, we characterize human ability using the NIH Toolbox as a framework. Looking forward, this framework allows us to determine connections between the trait space and clinical outcomes in different neurophysiological conditions, such as chronic pain.

Electrophysiological data can be obtained in humans but is limited to single afferents and passive stimulation. Here, we present a computational model that simulates neural spiking responses from a full population of mechanoreceptive afferents innervating the sole of the foot. Our work takes into account the unique mechanics of the skin tissue in the foot (including depth and hardness) and includes all afferent classes (both slowly and rapidly adapting) that signal skin indentation, slip, vibration, and stretch. Single-unit recordings of human afferent responses were used for validation and fitting of the model. We find that simulated afferent firing thresholds, as well as supra-threshold firing rates, match their empirical counterparts well. As a proof-of-concept, we then used the model to recreate neural population responses during walking, based on empirical data of the spatiotemporal pressure distribution on the foot sole. The model predicts sharp rises in neural activity during the initial contact phase as well as during lift-off and suggests that these are spatially constrained and differentially activate different receptor types.

Models matching these second-order correlations but assuming no higher-order interactions successfully describe the distribution of population states and capture most of the information content of the neural code. We demonstrate that this phenomenon may largely be a consequence of receptive field geometry in the retina, and may extend to other populations of neurons which encode low-dimensional geometric information, such as place cells.

We show these maximum-entropy models accurately capture the information-theoretic content of the activity of mouse retinal ganglion cells. Moreover, such models successfully describe a population of model neurons with identical receptive fields, driven purely by feed-forward input. In contrast, cells with spatially-scrambled receptive fields retain the same pattern of pairwise correlations, but second-order models capture only a small fraction of the information content of the resulting code, suggesting the specific geometric structure of receptive fields plays a part.

NWB supports a wide range of neurophysiology data and metadata, including from intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology and optical physiology experiments. NWB is in use by many labs internationally and is integrated with a growing list of popular software tools and services for data processing, analysis, and management.

NWB already supports a wide variety of data types, but neurophysiology experiments are highly diverse and can require the storage of new data types and additional metadata. In addition, research by its very nature outpaces data standardization, and new data modalities, experimental designs, and tools and services can also require the storage of data not supported by NWB. To support these new and specialized data types, NWB enables the creation and sharing of user-defined extensions to the standard.

As particular extensions gain traction within the community, they may be integrated into the core NWB format for broader use and standardization. We developed a formal, community-driven review process for refining the core format so that NWB can adapt to evolving data needs in neuroscience.

To facilitate the development, use, and review of NWB extensions, we developed the Neurodata Extensions Catalog (NDX Catalog), a novel web archive and associated tools. The NDX Catalog provides a convenient web interface for users to search for, discuss, test, and install NWB extensions. Associated tools enable users to easily create, document, and register new NWB extensions.

recWkWeT3VS92gTXi,Motor skill learning and execution in a distributed brain network,"The remarkable capacity of the brain to acquire and execute motor skills depends on a distributed motor network. While many components have been identified, less is known about their specific roles and interactions during skill learning and execution. Here we probe this network through the lens of complex, spatiotemporally precise motor sequences we train in rats. We focus on the basal ganglia and the contributions made by their main inputs, from motor cortex and thalamus, respectively. Using electrophysiological recordings, we find that the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), the main motor-related input nucleus of the basal ganglia, encodes the detailed kinematic structure of the learned motor sequences. We further show that a loss of the DLS renders animals unable to execute the learned idiosyncratic motor patterns, causing them to revert to simple species-typical behaviors. In addition, we find that not only the DLS, but also its motor cortical inputs are necessary for learning the skills we train. This very same pathway, however, becomes dispensable after the behaviors are acquired. In line with this, the loss of motor cortical inputs leaves the DLS activity encoding the kinematic structure of the behavior largely unaffected. In contrast, thalamic inputs to the DLS remain crucial for the generation of the learned skills and loss of these inputs disrupts performance akin to DLS lesions, causing a reversion to the same species-typical behavior. Together, our results suggest that the basal ganglia can play a role in the control of complex learned behaviors which goes beyond traditional models of basal ganglia function. They further suggest that motor cortex ‘tutors’ sub-cortical motor circuits during learning, potentially by guiding plasticity at thalamostriatal synapses. Such adaptive reprogramming of lower-level motor circuits may broaden their flexibility and allow them to store and generate complex learned motor skills.",Steffen Wolff,"Ashesh Dhawale, Harvard University; Raymond Ko, Harvard University; Bence Olveczky, Harvard University",Harvard University (grid.38142.3c),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-27 18:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 18:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/kYMbeR6MBVI

Several studies in humans indicate that task-related modulation of MGB and LGN is critical for auditory and visual speech recognition and is reduced in developmental dyslexia. These findings might be explained in a predictive coding framework, where predictions generated  in cerebral cortex are used to optimise the processing of auditory and visual speech in sensory thalami. However, to date it is unclear whether responses in sensory thalami and other subcortical sensory pathway nuclei can be explained by predictive coding or habituation to stimulus statistics. In a novel study, we used ultra-high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 7 Tesla to adjudicate between these two possibilities in the human subcortical auditory pathway. To elicit prediction error, we introduced frequency variations in pure tone sequences and abstract rules that manipulated the predictability of the tones orthogonally to the stimulus statistics. Our results show that predictability entailed in abstract rules drive mesoscopic responses to tones in the medial geniculate bodies and the inferior colliculi of the human auditory pathway.

First-time rodent dams seek and gather wandering/scattered pups back to the nest (pup retrieval), an essential aspect of maternal care. Over the decades, qualitative observations of the behaving animal have been presented in quantitative discrete units. However, systematic analysis of the sequence of goal-related movements that comprise the entire behavior and which would be ultimately essential for understanding the contribution of specific neural circuits and brain regions, is usually not analyzed. Here, we present results from pup retrieval behaviors of alloparental female mice (Surrogates or Sur) of two genotypes; Mecp2-heterozygotes (Het), a female mouse model for a neuropsychiatric disorder called Rett Syndrome and their wild type (WT) siblings. Frame-by-frame analysis over different phases (habituation, isolation and retrieval) was performed manually using DataVyu software. 
We previously showed that SurHet are inefficient at pup retrieval. Here, the sequence of pup retrieval crystallizes over time for SurWT, while it does not for SurHet. Day-by-day analysis shows dynamic changes in goal-related movements in individual animals in response to the same pup stimuli. SurHet behavior in different phases are similar to SurWT, suggesting that atypical dynamic patterns in SurHet behavior is dependent on context. Tactile sensory perception between adult and pups has been previously shown to be important for maternal behavior, by studies in the 1980s. Based on our results, we suggest that tactile stimulation of whiskers/face and somatosensation of the SurWT body may play essential roles in efficient pup retrieval, which might be adversely affected in SurHet. These results suggest atypical sensory processing in this female mouse model for Rett Syndrome.

The channels play essential roles in transporting Ca2+ and ATP. Panx1 is implicated in epilepsy, stroke, trauma, inflammation, or pain. A role in Parkinson’s disease has been proposed, but evidence thus far is lacking.  Here, the locomotor activity and visual-motor response of wild-type Tupfel longfin and panx1a knockout zebrafish larvae were tested after treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). MPTP is known to induce Parkinson's disease-like effects in the zebrafish by blocking the Complex I in mitochondria. Short term treatment with MPTP caused a decrease in the movement of the larvae. Locomotor activity worsened after incubation with Panx1 inhibitors probenecid and mefloquine. The analysis of biomarker expression levels demonstrated the upregulation of genes in panx1a knockout larvae with known functions in mitochondrial health and dopamine synthesis. A transcriptome analysis authenticated a broad dysregulation of metabolic processes, such as those affecting mitochondrial health. It was concluded that panx1a channels play roles in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in the zebrafish. Loss-of-function contributes to the severity of outcomes in the MPTP model of Parkinson's disease. ",Georg S Zoidl,"Georg R.

At each branch point there is a risk that the action potential will fail to propagate (branch point failure). Recent immunolabelling results have found that branch points are near nodes containing both voltage-gated Na+ channels and GABA_A receptors. Historically, GABA receptors on these sensory axons have been associated with presynaptic inhibition mediated by primary afferent depolarization. We used computer simulations of a previously reconstructed axon collateral branching pattern from a cat proprioceptive afferent to answer two questions: 1) how common is branch point failure, and 2) do GABA_A receptors increase the probability of failure? 

The geometry, branching, and myelination pattern of the axon collateral generated large regions of the g_Na/g_K parameter space where action potentials failed to propagate. Branch point failure was a common feature in the absence of GABA_A receptor activation. Coincident activation of GABA_A receptors facilitated transmission of action potentials, rescuing branch point failure rather than exacerbating it. These results are consistent with the emerging idea that transmission along somatosensory axon collaterals in the spinal cord is primed by nodal GABA_A receptors.",Noah Pardell,"Jones KE, Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute, University of Alberta; Bennett DJ, Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute, University of Alberta",University of Alberta (grid.17089.37),"Theme B: Neural Excitability, Synapses, and Glia",Interactive talk,2020-10-27 21:15:00+00:00,2020-10-27 21:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/SGO2eoGKrmQ

One of the well-studied claims of this hypothesis is the idea that the dorsal visual pathway is involved in visually guided motor behavior, and it is operating with a short memory. Conversely, this hypothesis claims that the ventral visual pathway is involved in object classification, and it works using a long-term memory. In this study, we tested these claims by training identical recurrent neural networks to either perform viewpoint-invariant object classification (a task attributed to dorsal stream) or orientation classification (a task attributed to dorsal stream) and measured how much they rely on their memory in each task. Using a modified leaky-integrator echo state recurrent network, we found that object classification requires a longer memory compared to orientation classification. However, when we used long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks, we observed that object classification requires longer memory only in larger datasets. Accordingly, our results suggest that having a longer memory is advantageous in performing ventral stream’s tasks more than their dorsal counterparts, as was originally suggested by the two-streams hypothesis.",Abolfazl Alipour,"John Beggs, Indiana University Bloomington; Joshua Brown, Indiana University Bloomington;  Thomas James, Brown Indiana University Bloomington;",Indiana University Bloomington (grid.411377.7),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-30 13:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 13:30:00+00:00,
recXSeDrs3inhqnV9,Modulation of synaptic plasticity in single neurons with transcranial direct current stimulation,"Background: Lasting therapeutic effects of transcranial direct current stimulation are thought to be mediated by synaptic plasticity. Direct current stimulation (DCS) is known to affect synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in vitro. We hypothesized that this is the result of a modulation of somatic spiking with DCS in the postsynaptic neuron, as opposed to indirect network effects. Previous studies with population activity provided only indirect evidence for this hypothesis. Here we aim to directly record somatic spiking in a postsynaptic neuron during LTP induction with concurrent DCS. 

Methods: We recorded single-neuron activity by patching the soma of individual CA1 pyramidal neurons in a rodent in-vitro slice preparation. LTP was induced with theta-burst stimulation (TBS) applied concurrently with DCS. To specifically test the causal role of somatic polarization during DCS, we manipulated this polarization via patch pipette current injections. To explain the observed effects, we used a computational multi-compartment neuron model that captures the effect of electric fields on membrane polarization and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.  

Results: We find that TBS-induced LTP was enhanced when paired with anodal DCS as well as depolarizing current injections. In both cases, somatic spiking during the TBS was increased,  suggesting that evoked somatic activity is indeed the primary factor affecting LTP modulation. However, the boost of LTP with DCS was less than expected given the increase in spiking activity alone. In some cells, we also observed spontaneous somatic spiking during DCS, suggesting that DCS also modulates LTP via spontaneous network activity. The computational model reproduces the observed effects of DCS on LTP and suggests that these effects are driven by both direct changes in postsynaptic spiking and indirect changes due to network activity 

Conclusion: DCS enhances synaptic plasticity by increasing postsynaptic somatic spiking, but we also find that an increase in network activity may limit this enhancement.

Whilst there are multiple theories proposed to explain sleeps role in forming optimal schemas and there are many computational models related to memory consolidation (Rennó-Costa, da Silva, Blanco, & Ribeiro, 2019) there appears to be a gap between the two approaches in their target areas of interest and explanatory scope; most models being too complex or too abstract to guide human sleep and memory research. In addition, there is a lack of testable computational accounts addressing sleeps role in forming predictive codes (Hinton et al, 1995; Hobson & Friston, 2012) in behaviourally well studied tasks.

We propose an abstract, neurally-plausible connectionist model of sleep-dependent memory processing of hippocampal generalization to show that offline generative replay provides sufficient conditions for the sleep effect to emerge in indirect association tasks (Ketz, Morkonda & O’Reilly, 2013; Kumaran & McClelland, 2012; Ellenbogen, 2007).

recXjszRCKaMbEkTU,The time course of decision-making: contribution of the electrophysiological version of the monetary incentive delay (e-MID) task ,"The Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task is a popular tool for studying the different stages of economic decision-making. During this task, participants are presented with a cue that signals possible gains/losses. This cue is followed by target detection, which requires a button press to win/avoid losses. Then, feedback reveals the success/failure of the performance. The MID task has been extensively used to investigate neural activity associated with different stages of decision-making. Specifically, the cues elicit affective processes of gain/loss anticipation (anticipation processes), which induce positive/negative arousal, and motivate approach/avoidance behaviors. The output of this process is integrated (integration processes) with further evaluative considerations, feeding in motivation processes that promote subsequent motor actions and decisions. Also, the delivery of the results elicits neural activity associated with the processing of gains and losses. This study exploits the temporal resolution of EEG to identify the neural correlates associated with these processes. To this purpose, 28 healthy younger adults performed a version of the MID task adapted to an ERP technique. The anticipation processes were analyzed through the cue-P3, which is correlated with the engagement of proactive cognitive control that increases in function of the reinforcement amount. The integration processes were analyzed through the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) elicited by the cue, which is associated with the engagement of effortful processes to future motor responses. The motivation processes beyond motor choice were analyzed through the Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP) and the target-P3. The LRP reflects the voluntary motor response after the decision threshold, while the target-P3 is elicited by the target and is modulated by the task-relevance and motivated attention. Finally, the feedback processes were analyzed through the frontocentral feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the feedback-P3. These ERPs were elicited by gain, loss and neutral gamble, and were compared in a within-subjects design.

recXk7bzq4e6CS5Tu,DNA Methylation Underlies Sexual Differentiation of Cell Type in the Brain ,"Most animals display sex-specific behaviors, such as mating, aggression and parental care, that are important for the continuation of the species. These behaviors are controlled by sexually dimorphic groups of neurons that are defined by their gene expression (i.e., neurochemical phenotype) in certain brain areas. Within several hypothalamic regions, for example, females have more neurons that express estrogen receptor alpha (ER𝛼) and kisspeptin than do males. Little is known regarding the biological processes that cause these sex differences to develop, but our research suggests that epigenetic mechanisms play a role. Expression of epigenetic enzymes that place and remove methyl marks is highest during the first week of life in the hypothalamus and differs by sex. This suggests that DNA methylation is a critical mechanism underlying sex differences in brain development. In addition, we find that inhibiting DNA methylation neonatally by injecting zebularine into the cerebral ventricles abolishes sex differences in the number of ER𝛼 cells at weaning in three hypothalamic areas: the preoptic area (POA), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), and arcuate nucleus (ARC). Interestingly, however, zebularine disrupts sex differences differently in each brain area. In the POA and VMH, zebularine treatment increases ER𝛼 labeling in males to female-like levels, while in the ARC, zebularine decreases ER𝛼 labeling in females to male-like levels. Effects of zebularine on kisspeptin also differs by region: in the anteroventral periventricular region, kisspeptin cell number is unaffected by inhibition of DNA methylation, but kisspeptin labeling in the ARC is reduced in females after zebularine treatment. Finally, we recently tested the role of demethylating enzymes on sex differences in neurochemical phenotype. We find that early-life knock-down of Tet2 and Tet3 feminizes (i.e., increases) ER𝛼 labeling in the ARC of males. Thus, both DNA methylation and demethylation early in life sculpt sex differences in cell type in the hypothalamus.",Laura Cortes (She/Her),"Carla Cisternas, Georgia State; Damian Mason, Georgia State; Iagn Kenji Cabahug, Georgia State; Nancy Forger, Georgia State ",Georgia State University (grid.256304.6),"Theme A: Development, Neurodegenerative Disorders and Injury",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 17:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 17:15:00+00:00,

Previous EEG studies have found that this response scales parametrically with proportion of symmetry in symmetry + noise displays. The parametric symmetry response happens in many tasks, but it is enhanced when the task requires active regularity discrimination. However, the origins and time course of this selective enhancement are unclear. Here we answered remaining questions with new source dipole analysis in a reanalysis of the data originally reported by Makin et al. (2020). As assumed, the parametric symmetry response found at the sensor level was generated by a pair of dipoles in the left and right extrastriate cortex, a finding comparable with previous fMRI research. This bilateral activity was itself enhanced during regularity discrimination, in accordance with original findings. However, we identified a third, and later, symmetry response in the posterior cingulate during regularity discrimination. The spatial distribution of this component was characterized by a strong positive potential over the vertex of the scalp at approximately 580 ms. Unlike the extrastriate response, this previously unknown activation only indexes strong, task relevant regularity signals.

The particular response that an animal selects may depend on the proximity of the threat, competing stimuli, or the animal's internal state. Responses to an aversive stimuli are diverse and dynamic, and capturing this complexity while also collecting neurophysiological data has been a challenge. In the virtual burrow assay, mice display both active and passive learned responses to odorants that have been associated with an aversive stimulus. As previously described, mice in this virtual burrow will actively ingress (entering the burrow enclosure) or passively tremble (leading to small oscillations in the burrow position). Here, we developed a method to compare and quantify ingresses and trembles. We observed tremble responses that consist of a 4-6Hz oscillation. These responses are more prominent during the presentation of aversive conditioned stimuli (both in duration and magnitude). Tremble, like ingress, undergoes extinction, but is not associated with ingress responses and thus seems to reflect a distinct behavioral response.",Pia-Kelsey O'Neill,Jozsef Meszaros,Columbia University,"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-27 21:15:00+00:00,2020-10-27 21:30:00+00:00,

Although widely accepted as being neurodevelopmental in nature, the specific abnormalities of brain function which underlie the disorder remain poorly understood. A growing number of studies have investigated the neuropathology of autism using functional connectivity MRI, which investigates the relations among large-scale, functionally specialized brain networks. Research with healthy adults has demonstrated that the antagonistic “default” and “dorsal attention” networks, which subserve internally and externally directed cognition, respectively, are modulated by a third “frontoparietal control” network, which flexibly couples with either the default or dorsal attention network depending upon locus of attention. We investigated resting-state functional connectivity within and between the default, dorsal attention and frontoparietal control networks in a group of 25 adult males with ASD and a control group matched on age, I.Q., and motion parameters. Differentiation of all three networks, reflecting the relative strength of functional connectivity within vs. between nodes of these networks, was reduced in the ASD group. In addition, the number of nodes exhibiting anticorrelation between the default and dorsal attention networks was significantly reduced in ASD. Region-of-interest analyses identified abnormal functional connectivity of the left frontal eye fields, which were hyperconnected to the medial prefrontal cortex and hypoconnected to the insula, which are thought to mediate context-memory binding and salient stimulus detection, respectively. Finally, graph theoretic analysis demonstrated an increase in betweenness-centrality of the left middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann Area 6), a crucial interconnector node, in the ASD group. These results provide evidence that the typical resting-state relationships among the default, dorsal attention, and frontoparietal control networks are altered in ASD.

recY13MmcAzW7bAR4,"Neural Mechanisms of Object-based Attention: Decoding EEG Alpha When Anticipating Faces, Scenes, and Tools","Attentional selection mechanisms in visual cortex involve changes in oscillatory neural activity in the electroencephalography (EEG) alpha band (8–12 Hz), with decreased alpha indicating focal enhancement of cortical activity and increased alpha indicating suppression of cortical activity. This pattern has been observed for spatial selective attention and attention to visual stimulus features such as color and motion. We investigated whether attention to categories of objects involves similar alpha-mediated changes in focal cortical excitability. In experiment 1, 20 volunteers (8 males; 12 females) were cued (80% predictive) on a trial-by-trial basis to anticipate different objects (faces, scenes, or tools). Support vector machine decoding of alpha power patterns revealed that late (>500 ms latency) in the cue-to-target foreperiod, EEG alpha differed with the to-be-attended object category, whereas patterns of the theta, beta, and gamma frequency bands were not systematically different across object conditions. In experiment 2, to control for the possibility that decoding of the physical features of cues led to our results, 25 participants (9 males; 16 females) performed a similar task as experiment 1, but with cues that were nonpredictive of the subsequently presented object category. Alpha decoding was now only significant in the early (<200 ms) foreperiod. In experiment 3, to control for the possibility that task set differences between the different object categories led to our experiment 1 results, 12 participants (5 males; 7 females) performed a predictive cuing task where the discrimination task for different objects was identical across object categories. The results replicated experiment 1.

recY5AzHcPnH8QGAI,Frequent nightmares and parasympathetic activity reflected in increased heart rate during sleep,"Nightmare Disorder, a parasomnia generally considered to be related to REM phase, is associated with vivid, emotionally dysphoric dreams commonly resulting in awakening and microarousals, experienced at least on a weekly basis. Poor subjective sleep quality is characterised by pathophysiological features such as abnormal arousal processes and sympathetic influences, which might lead to fragmented sleep. Dysfunctional parasympathetic regulation, especially before and during REM phases, brings about changes in the heart rate and its variability in subjects with Nightmare Disorder. We hypothesised that cardiac variability is attenuated in participants experiencing frequent nightmares as opposed to healthy control subjects during less deep sleep stages. Based on the second-nights’ polysomnographic recordings of 23 Nightmare Disordered (NM) and 29 control (CTL) subjects, we examined heart rate variability (HRV) during pre-REM, REM, post-REM and slow wave sleep periods, separately. In addition, two types of wakeful periods were also included in the analysis – besides resting state before sleep onset, ECG recordings of the participants during an emotional picture rating task were analysed. According to our results, a significant difference was found in the mean heart rate (HR) of the NM and CTL groups in the nocturnal segments but not during resting wakefulness before sleep onset, suggesting autonomic dysregulation, specifically during sleep in Nightmare Disorder. However, despite the accelerated heart rate in the NM subjects at night, they did not exhibit lower HRV. Our findings also show remarkable differences between the examined sleep stages regardless of the group, demonstrating major changes in the autonomic regulation throughout sleep. Regarding the emotional task, we also found a contrast between the NM and CTL subjects’ HR and HRV, which might indicate altered processes of emotion regulation in Nightmare Disorder.",Vivien Tomacsek,"Borbála Blaskovich, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Germany; Anna Király, Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary; Richárd Reichardt, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary; Péter Simor, Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary",Eötvös Loránd University (grid.5591.8),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-26 16:30:00+00:00,2020-10-26 16:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/bWlag9v7hMA
recY98NizL753xW1e,Towards a large-scale model of sleeping brain: sleep spindles in network mass models,"The hierarchical nesting of sleep spindles and slow oscillations is considered a precursor of successful episodic memory consolidation where it, presumably, sets the stage for memory traces migration from short-term hippocampal storage to longer-lasting neocortical sites. Here we take the first steps towards integrating thalamocortical projections into a large-scale brain model and modelling whole-brain cortical slow-wave activity and thalamic spindles as seen in non-REM sleep. We model the thalamus as a node containing one excitatory and one inhibitory mass representing thalamocortical relay neurons and thalamic reticular nuclei, respectively. We found dynamically interesting spindle-promoting regimes and we were also able to control the inter-spindle interval, spindle duration, and shape of spindle envelope. Secondly, we connected the thalamic node to one cortical node, modelled as excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuronal masses. The excitatory mass contains a spike-triggered adaptation mechanism and is parametrised to sit in the limit cycle generating slow oscillations. Moreover, the cortical node is adapted to include perturbation via transcranial current stimulation. Our results when investigating the dynamical repertoire show that, upon connection, the thalamic spindles are imprinted into cortical node activity where they modulate slow oscillation envelope, and that slow oscillation activity of the cortex, in turn, shapes spindling behaviour of thalamocortical relay mass by affecting spindle duration and inter-spindle interval. Our connected model also conserves the phase-phase and phase-amplitude couplings reported in the literature on observed EEG data. Our results suggest that thalamic mass model of spindle activity can be connected to various mass or mean-field models of cortical nodes and, after careful treatment of network connections and delays, we believe that our conclusions would carry over to the large-scale network model.",Nikola Jajcay,"Nikola Jajcay, TU Berlin, Institute of Computer Science, CAS, Prague; Klaus Obermayer, TU Berlin, Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Berlin",Technical University of Berlin (grid.6734.6),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-27 10:15:00+00:00,2020-10-27 10:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/S704JUFbbCk

Apart from the involvement of the action observation network and areas related to human body perception, evidence of other brain areas’ involvement is still scarce. In this high-resolution 7T fMRI study with representational similarity analysis (RSA), we examined the representational geometry of participants’ subjective understandings of whole body images, using a large set of exemplars of bodily actions and emotions. Besides using conventional univariate/multivariate analysis, we obtained subjective reports of the perceived actions and emotions from the participants, and mapped these individual reports to a common high-dimensional space using pre-trained word embeddings. The representations for perceived action and emotion were high dimensional, both correlated to but not reducible to the predefined action and emotion categories. The perceived emotion representations further contained dimensions for the valence, and for fear and sad expressions.  With searchlight RSA, we found that the left middle superior temporal sulcus (L mSTS) and left dorsal premotor cortex (L PMd) respectively corresponded to these behavioral representations. Further with task-residual functional connectivity and hierarchical clustering, we found that areas in the action observation network and the semantic/default-mode network were functionally connected to these two seed regions, and showed the most similar representations to them.

recYK9Rh3OspLlWdX,Neural correlates of computational complexity in a problem-solving task,"Previous studies have characterised a cognitive control network that is modulated by cognitive load. However, these studies have mainly focused on perceptual tasks in which cognitive load can be characterised by the level of conflict or noise in the signal. It remains an open question how cognitive load of computational complex problems affects the cognitive control network. In these problems, cognitive load is arguably driven by a set of features related to the number of computation steps, computational time and memory used. Computational complexity theory has been suggested to provide a general theoretical framework that lends itself to characterising computational requirements of problem-solving. Previous work has shown that complexity affects human performance and time-on-task when solving problems; however, the neural underpinnings of this effect have not been examined. Here we study the effect of computational complexity on neural processes, and in particular, on the cognitive control network. We performed an ultra-high field fMRI study in which participants underwent scanning while solving instances of the knapsack problem, a canonical computational problem strongly associated with models of decision-making. Our behavioural results replicate previous findings on the effect of complexity on human performance. We also find that computational complexity correlates with activation in areas implicated in cognitive control, namely anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Moreover, we find that activity in the angular gyrus (aG), a brain region implicated in numerical cognition, is also modulated by complexity. Overall, our results complement previous findings that use perceptual and probabilistic tasks to study cognitive control.

recYWuRoDWTQ9xrQ5,Brain-Wide Tracing of Inputs to the LP-ACC Reciprocal Circuit,"The rodent lateral posterior thalamus (LP) plays an important role in cortical communication through dense reciprocal connectivity with multiple cortical areas. A defining input to the medial subdivision of LP is the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which plays an integral role in top-down sensory processing and modulates visual selectivity via LP and the superior colliculus (SC). With broader receptive fields and feature tuning, LP is unlikely to provide precise visual encoding. Instead, LP likely provides ACC neurons with visual inputs filtered for behavioral context and convey top-down behavioral priorities from the ACC to other visual areas. To define the inputs that can ultimately shape this reciprocal interaction, we sought to map brain-wide monosynaptic inputs to the bottom-up LP-ACC and top-down ACC-LP circuits.

Brain-wide inputs to these two circuits differ significantly. Although LP activity is believed to be largely driven by cortical inputs, subcortical structures comprise more than half of input to LP-ACC, many possibly serving as inhibitory modulators. Cortical inputs to LP-ACC neurons largely originate from sensory and associative areas, with somatosensory and auditory inputs comparable to visual inputs. In contrast, most ACC-LP neurons receive inputs from frontal and sensorimotor cortical areas. Notably, both nodes of the reciprocal circuit receive extensive retrosplenial cortex (RSC) input and from higher visual areas AM & PM. Our data also show that SC is the largest single input to LP-ACC. Importantly, these originate from the intermediate and deep layers of the SC, which integrates multimodal information and orienting. This contrasts to posterior LP which receives SC input from superficial layers conveying visual information. This also points to LP as a potential node for SC feedback to the ACC. 

Our brain-wide anatomical mapping of inputs to the reciprocal LP-ACC pathways provide a roadmap to understanding LP’s interaction with frontal areas for attentional control and visuomotor functions.

To assess the use of environmental statistics in updating predictions, adults with (N=21) and without (N=20) autism performed a task in which they responded to the completion of a pattern of three sequentially presented shapes. Across blocks of ~120 pattern initiations, the probability of pattern completion varied between 100%, 86%, 66%, and 33%. The ability to infer a change in the probability of pattern completion was assessed with reaction time and high-density electroencephalography (EEG), with a particular focus on CNV and P300 components in the analyses of evoked brain potentials. The modulation of P300 and CNV as a function of stimulus probability was significantly diminished in the autism group. Further, a linear classifier trained to discriminate between individuals with autism and controls based on average brain responses to target trials (at all electrodes and time points) revealed successful classification (~80% accuracy) when all probability conditions are given as input. We also presented a passive auditory oddball paradigm in which the probability of deviant tones was 4%, 8%, or 16% in different blocks. Preliminary analyses of the mismatch negativity (MMN) component suggest that the brain is able to preattentively calculate stimulus statistics in autism. Taken together, these data might indicate that the specific problem with predictive processing in autism is not in registering environmental statistics, but in applying the statistics to making predictions.",Seydanur Tikir,"Seydanur Tikir, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States of America; Michael J.

recYbW3Z7viWyXbg4,The surface geometry of cerebral cortex induces topological changes of cortical traveling waves,"On the curved surfaces of living and nonliving materials, planar excitable wavefronts frequently exhibit a directional change and subsequently undergo a discontinuous (topological) change; i.e., a series of wavefront dynamics from collision, annihilation to splitting. Theoretical studies have shown that excitable planar stable waves change their topology significantly depending on the initial conditions on flat surfaces, whereas the directional change of the waves occurs based on the geometry of curved surfaces. However, it is not clear if the geometry of curved surfaces induces this topological change. In this study, we first demonstrated that the curved surface geometry induces bending, collision, and splitting of a planar stable wavefront by numerically solving an excitable reaction–diffusion equation on a bell-shaped surface. We determined two necessary conditions for inducing the topological change: the characteristic length of the curved surface (i.e., the height of the bell-shaped structure) should be greater than the width of the wave, and the ratio of the height to the width of the bell shape should be greater than a threshold. As for the geometrical mechanism of the latter, we found that a bifurcation of the geodesics on the curved surface provides the alternative minimal paths of the wavefront, which circumvent the surface region with a high local curvature, thereby resulting in the topological change. These conditions imply that the topological change of the wavefront can be predicted on the basis of the curved surfaces, whose structures are larger than the wave width.",Kazuya Horibe,"Ken-ichi Hironaka, Katsuyoshi Matsushita, Koichi Fujimoto",Osaka University (grid.136593.b),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-28 05:15:00+00:00,2020-10-28 05:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/HHWGUBAitbk
recYgfM6s3eUgGi24,NMDA receptors promote hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and the associated co-activity of CA1 pyramidal cells. ,"Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) support the reactivation of memory representations, relaying information to neocortex during “offline” and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. While blockade of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) is known to affect both learning and subsequent consolidation, the specific contributions of NMDAR activation to SWR-associated activity remain unclear. Here, we combine biophysical modeling with in vivo local field potential (LFP) and unit recording to quantify changes in SWR dynamics following inactivation of NMDAR. In a biophysical model of CA3-CA1 SWR activity, we find that NMDAR removal leads to reduced SWR density, but spares SWR properties such as duration, cell recruitment and ripple frequency. These predictions are confirmed by experiments in which NMDAR-mediated transmission in rats was inhibited using 3 different NMDAR antagonists, while recording dorsal CA1 LFP. In the model, loss of NMDAR-mediated conductances also induced a reduction in the proportion of cell pairs that co-activate significantly above chance across multiple events. Again, this prediction is corroborated by dorsal CA1 single-unit recordings, where the NMDAR blocker ketamine disrupted correlated spiking during SWR. 
Our results are consistent with a framework in which NMDA receptors both promote activation of SWR events and organize SWR-associated spiking content. This suggests that, while SWR are short-lived events emerging in fast excitatory-inhibitory networks, slower network components including NMDAR-mediated currents contribute to ripple density and promote consistency in the spiking content across ripples, underpinning mechanisms for fine-tuning of memory consolidation processes.

recYx7k1bJQszwMrL,Endocannabinoid System as an alternative way for neuropathic pain treatment,"Neuropathic pain is a debilitating condition, which can occur in both the central and peripheral nervous system lesions. Its cost could amount to as much as $160 billion annually in the United States. The magnitude of the cost is associated with scarce effective treatment for this condition. Research made with the Endocannabinoid System are raising its potentiality to be an alternative way for the treatment of this condition. That fact based the production of this review, with systematic reviews and reviews searched via PubMed. 
Clinical evidence has suggested cannabis-based medical extracts may be helpful as an adjuvant treatment for some patients with neuropathic pain symptoms, especially the activation of CB1 receptors by Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). However, side effects related to the activation of CB1 receptors could be harmful, as CB1 is expressed in higher function areas in the central nervous system, representing a threat specially for individuals with a history of neuropsychiatric conditions. Local injection of cannabinoids has shown effectiveness as CB1 receptors are present in peripheral tissue. It has been demonstr ated that oromucosal spray containing equal mixture of THC and Cannabidiol (CBD) induced significant antinociceptive effects in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain and has also suggested the capacity of CDB to reduce THC’s psychotic effects. Furthermore, smoked cannabis has presented better results as a second-line treatment, as it has presented a dose-dependent anti-nociceptive effect capable of attenuating neuropathic pain. The inhibition of endocannabinoids degrading enzymes can lead up to elevated levels of these substances where their actions can produce analgesia. This strategy represents an alternative to the global activation of CB1 receptors, which is associated with adverse effects. Even though the results are promising, the evidence is not strong enough for its disseminated use. There are gaps to be filled, for example the lack of natural versus synthetic compounds comparison.

Complete circuit mapping at the synaptic scale (nanoscale) has the potential to inform wide ranging questions in neuroscience, such as understanding how circuit architecture leads to activity, or how genetics or disease affect neural architecture. Recent technological advances are enabling connectomics datasets to scale into the tens or hundreds of thousands of neurons and millions of synapses. Increasingly, learning from and comparing such large connectome datasets will require techniques for statistical learning on network data. Here we describe several examples of such statistical techniques on the Drosophila larva connectome. For example, we present methodology for clustering and model fitting on the connectome, and show that statistical models of networks can be used to inform the clustering process. We show that the connectivity-based clustering is sensible in terms of known cell types, but also suggests new groupings of neurons for investigation. Then, we briefly touch on other statistical techniques and how they can be applied to connectomes. These methods will enable automated analyses of connectomes at scale (such as classifying cells into types based on their connectivity), but also serve as a basis for future work on comparing connectomes across individual, taxa, or disease state, for example. We provide implementations of all of these methods via an open-source Python package, graspologic.

In connected environments, optimal navigation requires keeping track of one’s location and of the available connections between subspaces. We examined whether the dorsal CA1 place cells of rats encode environmental connectivity in four geometrically-identical boxes arranged in a square. Rats moved between boxes by pushing saloon-type doors that could be locked in one or both directions. While rats demonstrated knowledge of environmental connectivity, their place cells did not respond to connectivity changes, nor did they represent doorways differently from other locations. Importantly, place cells represented location globally despite the repetitive geometry.

recZ7wW74aPrEP8KB,Fast-spiking interneurons support the development of symmetrical head-direction tuning curves,"The postsubiculum (PoSub) is the cortical relay of the head-direction (HD) signal, projecting to the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex, transferring HD inputs from the thalamus. Recent evidence from our laboratory suggests a topographical arrangement of the HD signal within the PoSub, as evidenced by symmetrical tuning of fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons. Specifically, FS cells show a 1-, 2- or 3-fold symmetries in their tuning to HD. The origin of this arrangement is unknown. It could reflect topographical arrangement of local (<200 um) excitatory HD cells. Alternatively, it could result from a transformation of thalamic inputs directly by the inhibitory networks. To address this question, we have investigated the problem from a computational perspective. Here, we developed mechanistic, optimised, and random models to capture the emergence of the fast-spiking interneuron tuning curves based on thalamocortical and inter-inhibitory cell connectivity. 
In a model of structured symmetric inputs to FS cells, constraining tuning curves variance to HD forces the density of each symmetry within the FS cell population to reflect exactly its contribution to input decoding. Conversely, the objective of recreating the inputs leads to a biologically plausible plasticity rule, assuming that (i) FS cells operate in a linear regime and (ii) connections between FS cells are plastic. Although the model accounts for tuning curve and fold distribution, the learning rule did not constraint the latter. Accordingly, a network with random connections that are optimized on the firing modulation of the FS cell tuning curves (range, mean and average but not symmetries) recapitulates the experimental data. Learning of a precise structure of thalamocortical connections seems therefore not necessary. We conclude that FS-FS connections and linear integration of thalamic inputs by FS cells are sufficient prerequisites for the emergence of spatially-symmetric responses in the brain’s navigation system.

Mice show defensive behaviour to stimuli sweeping overhead, like a bird cruising the sky. Here, we found that mice reduced their defensive freezing after sessions with a stimulus passing overhead repeatedly. This habituation is stimulus-specific, as mice freeze again to a novel shape. This allows us to investigate the invariances in the mouse visual system. The mice generalize over retinotopic location and over size and shape, but distinguish objects when they differ in both size and shape. Innate visual defensive responses are thus strongly influenced by previous experience as mice learn to ignore specific stimuli.

However, this spiking activity is seldom related to behavioral performance. We studied the responses of inferotemporal (IT) neurons, which exhibit object-selective activity, along with Frontal Eye Field (FEF) neurons, which exhibit spatially-selective activity, during the delay period of an object WM task. Unlike the spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) within these areas, which were poor predictors of behavioral performance, the phase-locking of IT spikes and LFPs with the beta band of FEF LFPs robustly predicted successful WM maintenance. In addition, IT neurons exhibited greater object-selective persistent activity when their spikes were locked to the phase of FEF LFPs.  These results demonstrate a key role of coordination between prefrontal and temporal cortex in the successful maintenance of visual information during WM.

recZFsHOnQk8CyMiC,Optimal control of approach-avoidance dynamics,"Animals must continuously adjust their behavior to pursue potential rewards (e.g., chasing prey) while evading potential threats (e.g., avoiding predators). To behave optimally, animals must also use their knowledge about the dynamics of their environment (e.g., a predators’ agility) to guide their actions. The current experiment seeks to develop a computational framework for understanding this goal pursuit.

Computational models of approach-avoid behaviors have been largely limited to describing simplified economic choices, without providing a clear understanding of how continuous actions are controlled across time. Our approach leverages engineering algorithms from Optimal Control Theory, a framework also used in computational models of online motor control. These models are inherently well-suited for describing the continuous dynamics of natural behavior, while being far less computationally demanding than model-based planning over discretized states and actions.

In the current project, we sought to understand how rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) played a dynamic predator-prey computer game. Monkeys controlled an avatar with a joystick, chasing a prey avatar to gain juice and evading a predator avatar to avoid a timeout. We used Inverse Optimal Control to infer the valuation of prey capture and predator avoidance that best explained monkeys' actions under a standard optimal control algorithm (iLQR). Our model predicted the monkeys’ full trajectories well above chance, including in held-out trials. The model’s inferred values on prey and predator were also significantly correlated with the amount of reward and punishment at stake, reflecting the animals’ understanding of the task.

Optimal control theory offers rational process models for translating appetitive and aversive goals into extended behaviors, while maintaining computational feasibility.

recZVDpwpoigPHE7v,Robustness and circuit dynamics of reciprocally inhibitory neurons to perturbation and modulation,"Essential rhythmic motor patterns are produced by central pattern generators (CPGs). Half-center oscillators (HCOs) are the building blocks of many CPG networks. They consist of two typically nonoscillotary neurons, or groups of neurons, connected by reciprocal inhibitory synapses. There are two fundamental mechanisms of antiphase oscillations in reciprocally inhibitory circuits: “release” and “escape”. We describe how dynamics of HCOs with “release” and “escape” mechanisms is modulated by their intrinsic properties, neurotransmitters and global perturbations, such as temperature.
One way of exploring how synaptic and intrinsic properties shape motor patterns is to control the parameters critical for production of neural output. Thus, we used the dynamic clamp to create HCO circuits of two pharmacologically isolated biological neurons from the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab. HCO circuits were formed by connecting two neurons with artificial reciprocal inhibitory synapses and adding hyperpolarization-activated inward currents. 
HCOs with “release” and “escape” mechanisms produce alternating bursting for different sets of synaptic and H-conductances. These conductances must be tightly correlated to achieve robust bursting in “escape”, but not in “release” mode. H-current oppositely modulates the cycle frequency of HCOs with different mechanisms, decreasing the frequency in “release”, while increasing the frequency in “escape” mode.
CPGs must be robust to various perturbations. Temperature is a global perturbation that differentially affects all biological processes. We assessed the response of HCOs to temperature changes. Increase in temperature could switch the mechanism of oscillations from “escape” to “release” and, thus, alter the way circuits respond to external stimuli. HCOs with “release” mechanism are less robust to temperature increases.

The theta rhythm is regulated by subcortical structures including the medial septum, but it is unclear how spatial information from place cells may reciprocally organize subcortical theta-rhythmic activity. Here we recorded single-unit spiking from a constellation of subcortical and hippocampal sites to study spatial modulation of rhythmic spike timing in rats freely exploring an open environment. Our analysis revealed a novel class of neurons that we termed 'phaser cells,' characterized by a symmetric coupling between firing rate and spike theta-phase. Phaser cells encoded space by assigning distinct phases to allocentric isocontour levels of each cell's spatial firing pattern. In our dataset, phaser cells were predominantly located in the lateral septum, but also the hippocampus, anteroventral thalamus, lateral hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens. Unlike the unidirectional late-to-early phase precession of place cells, bidirectional phase modulation acted to return phaser cells to the same theta-phase along a given spatial isocontour, including cells that characteristically shifted to later phases at higher firing rates. Our dynamical models of intrinsic theta-bursting neurons demonstrated that experience-independent temporal coding mechanisms can qualitatively explain (1) the spatial rate-phase relationships of phaser cells and (2) the observed temporal segregation of phaser cells according to phase-shift direction. In open-field phaser cell simulations, competitive learning embedded phase-code entrainment maps into the weights of downstream targets, including path integration networks. Bayesian phase decoding revealed error correction capable of resetting path integration at subsecond timescales. Our findings suggest that phaser cells may instantiate a subcortical theta-rhythmic loop of spatial feedback.

Many source reconstruction algorithms for task-based MEG data are available. However, no consensus yet exists on the optimum algorithm for resting-state data.

Here, we evaluated the performance of six commonly-used source reconstruction algorithms based on minimum-norm and beamforming estimates. In the context of human resting-state MEG, we compared the algorithms using quantitative metrics, including resolution properties of inverse solutions and explained variance in sensor-level data. Next, we proposed a data-driven approach to reduce the atlas from the Human Connectome Project's multi-modal parcellation of the human cortex. This procedure produced a reduced cortical atlas with 230 regions, optimized to match the spatial resolution and the rank of MEG data from the current generation of MEG scanners.

However, the extent of their abilities in speech perception is unknown. Our aims were to test the cerebral processing for speech detection and language discrimination in the dog auditory cortex. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we studied awake and unrestrained dogs (n = 18). As speech stimuli, dogs heard fragments of speech in a familiar and an unfamiliar language, as control we scrambled the same stimuli. We hypothesized that if dogs can extract auditory regularities of speech, and of a familiar language, then the cerebral patterns in the auditory cortex would discriminate between speech and scrambled speech, and also between languages. Using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) we found that the cerebral patterns of activity in the bilateral primary auditory regions discriminated between speech and scrambled speech, this means that the auditory primary cortex performed speech detection; and the secondary auditory regions (the right rostral Sylvian gyrus, the left rostral suprasylvian gyrus, and the left caudal ectosylvian gyrus) were related with language discrimination (i.e. the cerebral patterns of cerebral activity discriminated between familiar and unfamiliar language in the speech condition). No auditory region discriminated between languages based on scrambled speech, this suggests that language discrimination wasn’t based on speaker-related cues. Additionally, we didn’t find a significant effect of the familiarity of the language in the primary auditory cortex response, this could suggest either that speech detection is independent of experience or that dogs extrapolate the rules that they learned in a familiar language to a unfamiliar language. These findings corroborate recent evidence that speech processing is functionally organized in the dog auditory cortex.

With its stereotypic organization, the vertebrate retina is an attractive model for investigating how such cellular patterns emerge during development. We have been investigating the spatial arrangement of H1 horizontal cells, an inhibitory interneuron subtype located in the outer retina. Using a transgenic line that fluorescently labels H1 horizontal cells we characterized the statistical properties of this sub-mosaic and investigated when during development its mosaic pattern first emerges. Using Nearest Neighbor Regularity Index, Voronoi Domain Regularity Index and Density Recovery Profile, our data suggests that the H1 mosaic is established as early as 3dpf. To visualize the formation of horizontal cell mosaics, we use high resolution in vivo time-lapse imaging and perform comprehensive quantitative analysis on individual cell trajectories dynamics. Preliminary analysis suggests that mosaic formation could be divided into at least 3 phases – proliferation, migration and finally a refinement phase. We hypothesized that cell-cell interaction is crucial in the active migration phase in which cells are sampling the space to ensure maximal spacing to its immediate neighbors. Using these datasets, we are implementing a data driven approach to build an agent-based model to serve as a platform to test various hypotheses of neural circuit formation. Taken together we anticipate that our approach will reveal mechanistic insights into how a distinct horizontal cell subtype establishes and maintains its mosaic arrangement.",Pui-Shee Lee (she/her),"Leanne Godinho, Institute of Neuronal Cell Biology, Technical University Munich",Technical University of Munich,"Theme A: Development, Neurodegenerative Disorders and Injury",Interactive talk,2020-10-30 21:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 21:30:00+00:00,
recaQPcAGxQLPL1ep,Differential acute behavioral responses to (±)-DOI injected in a novel or familiar environment,"Serotonergic psychedelics induce profound changes at multiple levels of neuroplasticity that putatively aid lasting remission from a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. In humans, heightened neuroplasticity was linked to heightened environmental sensitivity of acute and long-term psychedelic effects to both emotional/mental and physical context in which the treatment occurs, but such non-pharmacological factors of psychedelic response have been largely overlooked in animal models that remain crucial for discoveries on mechanisms of drug action. 

Familiarity is one of the main environmental factors emphasized in clinical settings. In this study, we investigated whether familiarity of the environmental context during administration of psychedelic (±)-DOI would modulate measures of psychedelic effects in mice – head-twitch (HTR) and ear-scratch (ESR) responses – as well as any changes in locomotive exploration and interaction with novel objects. To do this, one group of wild-type C57BL/6J male mice was habituated to the injection context extensively prior to testing whereas the context was novel for the second group.

2mg/kg (±)-DOI induced a locomotor suppression regardless of injection context, but ESR to 2mg/kg (±)-DOI was higher in the non-habituated than in habituated animals, with a similar trend observable for HTR. Additionally, 2mg/kg (±)-DOI reduced novel object interaction in habituated animals, hypothetically signalling a cognitive shift from external processing of the environment to internal processing of emotional states and mind-generated stimuli. In non-habituated animals, vehicle control group had lower object interaction than habituated controls, likely due to attention competition for exploring both the novel environment and the novel objects, but (±)-DOI did not induce further drops in interaction times.

To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first attempt of investigating the effect of familiarity of the drug injection environment in mice on both the acute behavioural responses to a psychedelic drug and on the accompanying changes in exploration. A subsequent ex vivo imaging study will also be a first attempt to look at environmental effects on brain structure. 

In my presentation I will also outline our future studies investigating whether (±)-DOI can influence structural brain plasticity and cognitive plasticity, referring to an increased capability for flexible cognitive change, in the long-term, after the drug has cleared the system.

recaSk8kuPq0cEizX,Supralinear networks with short-term plasticity can account for transient neuronal dynamics in the olfactory system,"The olfactory system is widely believed to implement an autoassociative memory network capa- ble of generating similar representations in response to chemically distinct but functionally related odorants. Classic autoassociative memory models rely on strong recurrent excitatory connec- tions accompanied by attractor dynamics, which exhibit persistent activity even after removing the stimulus. However, multiple experimental studies in the mammalian piriform cortex and in the te- lencephalic area Dp of zebrafish have revealed that odor stimuli evoke transient responses with a precise excitation-inhibition balance. This balance implies that neural circuits may operate as inhibition-stabilized networks during stimulation. Here, we studied how transient responses can arise in networks with supralinear transfer functions by analyzing their behavior in response to external inputs. We found that transient responses can arise when network dynamics switch from stable to unstable by additional afferent inputs and are eventually re-stabilized through short-term plasticity mechanisms. We identified E onto I short-term plasticity as the most promising mech- anism in this process. By contrast, both spike-frequency adaptation and E onto E short-term plasticity were inconsistent with specific aspects of experimental data. In summary, we provide a modeling framework that accounts for transient neuronal dynamics in the olfactory system, which could be applied to other sensory systems.",Yue Kris Wu,"Rainer W.

recaV9zLjYZyCQC0h,Evidence accumulation in the human brain using a novel continuous dot-motion task,"Electrophysiological studies in non-human primates have shown that evidence accumulation is characterised by neural ramping activity that scales with sensory evidence. In humans the same ramping activity is reflected in the centro-parietal positivity (CPP) measured with EEG. However, when measuring the CPP subjects typically perform single trials, during which the amount of evidence presented is constant over time. In the natural world, the amount of evidence varies over time and it is not always clear over what timescale evidence needs to be accumulated. 

In this study, we investigated whether we could measure flexible changes in the CPP depending on how far back in time participants should accumulate sensory evidence. We designed a continuous evidence accumulation task in which the amount of evidence varies constantly. Participants have to detect stable phases in which evidence remains consistent for several seconds. Depending upon the statistics of the environment, subjects should vary their kernel of evidence integration. We aimed to retrieve the integration kernel participants used in different task environments directly from the EEG signal and the behaviour. Behavioural results show that participants adapt their strategy depending on the condition. A direct read-out of the integration kernel from the behaviour indicates that specifically the frequency of the stable phases has an effect on the integration kernel. In addition, we show that a centro-parietal signal tracks the continuous update of evidence which differs for different frequencies of the stable phases. This signal seems to be directly related to the decision process as it is much weaker for a distractor stimulus of random dot motion that is shown simultaneously with the decision relevant motion stimulus.

I will present empirical work inferring depression severity from chronic neural oscillations and characterizing the immediate effects of DBS on whole-brain network oscillations.

recaiZcQVWAO1Q4L2,High dimensional neural representations for low dimensional tasks: a compromise between complex discrimination and generalization,"Adaptive behavior in humans, rodents, and other animals requires the combination of sensory cues from multiple input channels. Different neuronal representations of sensory variables can lead to a different discrimination and generalization ability, which entails different behavioral outcomes. In this study, we developed a novel behavioral task that required mice to integrate information from different whiskers to report the convexity of an object. The analysis of high speed videos of the whiskers revealed that the task could be solved by integrating linearly the whisker contacts with the object. This indicates that the task is low dimensional and does not require high dimensional neural representations. However, mouse barrel cortex represented stimuli using high dimensional representations, characterized by non-linear mixing of the different whisker channels. We show that this high dimensional representation would allow the animal to perform a broad class of significantly more complex tasks, with minimal disruption of the ability to generalize to novel situation in simpler tasks. A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to perform an artificial analogous of the task reproduced both the behavioral and neuronal results from the experiment. Our work thus far suggests that the barrel cortex operates in a regime that represents an efficient compromise between generalization, which is guaranteed by low-dimensional representations, and the ability to perform complex discrimination tasks, which is granted by high-dimensional representations.

recaoMHF0a3Mo5yHC,Complexity and 1/f slope jointly reflect cortical states across different E/I balances,"Characterization of cortical states is essential for understanding brain functioning in the absence of external stimuli. The balance between excitation and inhibition and the number of non-redundant activity patterns, indexed by the 1/f slope and LZc respectively, distinguish cortical states. However, the relation between these two measures has not been characterized. Here we analyzed the relation between 1/f slope and LZc with two modeling approaches and in empirical human EEG and monkey ECoG data. We contrasted resting state with propofol anesthesia, which is known to modulate the excitation-inhibition balance. We found convergent results among all strategies employed, showing an inverse and not trivial monotonic relation between 1/f slope and complexity. This behavior was observed even when the signals’ spectral properties were heavily manipulated, consistent at ECoG and EEG scales. Models also showed that LZc was strongly dependent on 1/f slope but independent of the signal’s spectral power law’s offset. Our results show that, although these measures have very distinct mathematical origins, they are closely related. We hypothesize that differentially entropic regimes could underlie the link between the excitation-inhibition balance and the vastness of repertoire of cortical systems.",Vicente Medel,"Martín Irani, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; Tomás Ossandón, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; Gonzalo Boncompte, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile",Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile,Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-27 22:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 22:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/M0wQWkk40bQ

For example, time is experienced differently at work than on holiday. However, leading explanations of time perception are not well-equipped to explain these deviations. We propose that salient changes in sensory dynamics are the units from which we construct our subjective estimates of duration, such that epochs will feel longer when they contain more salient events. We tested this idea in a human model-based neuroimaging experiment with a fully pre-registered analysis pipeline(osf.io/ce9tp). Forty participants watched naturalistic, silent videos and estimated their duration while fMRI was acquired. We extracted moment-to-moment changes in visual cortex BOLD dynamics (“events”), and using computational modelling we show that accumulated events in visual cortex predicted duration biases reflecting human experience of time. We were unable to predict subjective time from two control regions irrelevant for perceptual classification of our silent videos - auditory and somatosensory cortex - despite being able to predict ‘clock time’ from all three areas. Therefore, we show that trial-by-trial subjective duration judgements can be reconstructed purely from human BOLD activity reflecting perceptual classification of the content for which time is being judged. Our results reveal that human subjective time is based on information arising during the processing of our dynamic sensory environment, providing a computational basis for an end-to-end account of time perception.",Maxine Sherman (she/her),"Zafeirios Fountas, Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London, London, UK;  Anil K.

recb15hqlb2BcyBf7,Functional connectivity between right frontoparietal and visual networks is linked to visual processing speed,"The neural theory of visual attention (TVA) proposes that visual processing speed depends on the coordinated activity between frontoparietal and occipital brain areas. Previous research has shown that the coordinated activity (i.e., functional connectivity, FC) between the cingulo-opercular network (COn) and the right-frontoparietal network (RFPn) is linked to individual visual processing speed. However, evidence for a link between visual processing speed and the inter-FC of COn and RFPn with visual networks is still lacking. Forty-eight healthy human adult participants underwent resting-state (rs-)fMRI and performed a whole-report psychophysical task. To obtain inter-FC, we analyzed rs-fMRI data within the entire frequency range possible for our data (i.e., 0.01-0.4 Hz) to avoid discarding meaningful neural information. Following previous approaches, we examined the data in separate frequency bins (Hz): Slow-5 (0.01-0.027), Slow-4 (0.027-0.073), Slow-3 (0.073-0.198), and Slow-2 (0.198-0.4). We used the mathematical framework of TVA to estimate an individual, latent-level visual processing speed parameter. We found that the inter-FC between RFPn and visual networks was negatively associated with visual processing speed in Slow-5 and Slow-2, with no corresponding significant association for the inter-FC between COn and visual networks. These results provide first empirical evidence for an association of inter-FC at rest between RFPn and visual networks with the visual processing speed parameter. These findings suggest a direct influence on occipital regions from the right frontoparietal, but not frontoinsular, regions, to support visual processing speed.",Adriana Ruiz-Rizzo," Svenja Küchenhoff, LMU Munich; Christian Sorg, TU Munich; Sebastian Schneider, TU Munich; Oliver Kohl, LMU Munich; Hermann J.

recbBdhu8NBcHFXff,Active probing enhances the extraction of features for predicting seizures in a coupled neural mass model,"Active probing stimuli may be used to uncover underlying system dynamics that would be otherwise unobservable with passive analysis. The use of such approaches could be a way to tackle the challenging and yet unsolved problem of reliably forecasting the occurrence of seizures. That is, electrographic responses to period stimuli could highlight neuronal excitability and synchrony changes involved in the transition from interictal to ictal activity. In this work, we evaluate this hypothesis in two coupled populations of a commonly used seizure-generating neural mass model. Features are extracted while system parameters are slowly shifted from normal towards ictal activity and different scenarios or model settings are evaluated: low-frequency stimuli are applied to the input of one or both populations, while increasing neuronal excitability gain, decreasing slow inhibitory gain, or increasing inter-population coupling. Results show that the use of probing stimuli provided predictive value, as similar feature changes were observed while model parameters were shifted towards ictal activity. Observed changes such as increased lag-1 autocorrelation and increased variance may be related to the phenomenon of critical slowing. These increased recovery times from perturbations could be indicators of the loss of the system’s resilience and are common hallmarks of impending critical transitions. Overall, our results indicate that low-frequency probing stimuli may play a role in uncovering some of the neuronal dynamics leading up to seizure states and assist in designing accurate and reliable seizure forecasting systems.

recbFjABYiSzSTvLG,Attention differentially modulates multiunit activity in the LGN and V1 of macaque monkeys,"Attention promotes the selection of behaviorally relevant sensory signals. Attention effects, such as gain modulation of neuronal firing rate, are observed in all visual brain areas, including the visual thalamus (McAlonan et al., 2008; Maunsell, 2015). However, magnitudes of attentional gain modulations within and across visual brain areas differ depending on neuronal types, task, measurement, neuronal feature selectivity, etc. Diversity of attention effects across visual brain areas could suggest that attention effects depend on the functional architecture of a given area. To test this possibility, we evaluated attentional gain modulation in visual areas with distinct functional architectures using an aggregate measure of neuronal activity, multiunit firing rate. We recorded from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) in macaque monkeys performing a contrast change detection task requiring covert shifts of visual spatial attention. Because multiunit activity reflects pooled signals from neurons embedded in the local functional architecture, we tested specific predictions about the dependence of attentional modulation of multiunit firing rates on functional architecture. We found evidence for unique relationships between multiunit activity and functional architecture in the LGN and V1. Effects were mostly consistent across different thresholds used to sort multiunits and temporal analysis windows. Consistent with single unit measures, attentional modulation of multiunits depended on whether multiunits were tuned to task-relevant visual features. Together these findings suggest that attentional modulation of multiunit activity in visual areas must be considered within the context of the underlying functional architecture.

recbGxwADa69rcfnm,Individual Differences in Anxious Temperament relate to Differences in Brain Morphometrics,"Anxiety disorders constitute the most prevalent subgroup of mental disorders in most western societies, with an estimated lifetime incidence of 33.7% in the US. Anxiety can be defined as a prolonged state of apprehension elicited by unpredictable threats, or threats that are spatially or temporally distant. The current study utilized structural images from three studies (N=75) to examine individual differences in different mood and anxiety socioemotional questionnaires (Beck Depression Inventory, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire90, Ruminative Response Scale) and both cortical and subcortical brain metrics using surface-based morphometry. Cortical results indicated that increases in both the STAI and MASQ90 (general anxiety) related to increased grey matter area in the bilateral occipital pole (i.e., pericalcarine cortex, lingual gyrus). While subcortical results indicated that increased bilateral amygdala volume was related to increases in the STAI, MASQ90 (general anxiety) and RRS (rumination). Additionally, increases in bilateral nucleus accumbens volume was related to the positive affect dimension of the MASQ90. Results suggest that individual differences in anxious temperament, as measured by the STAI and MASQ90, may be related to increased visual cortex area, perhaps related to hypervigilance of the environment. Additionally, increased anxious temperament as measured by the STAI, MASQ90 and RRS, appear related to increased volume of the amygdala, again perhaps suggesting, increased threat processing due to hypervigilance. Finally, increased positive affect, as measured by the MASQ90, was related to increased nucleus accumbens volume, possibly indicating the role of dopaminergic ventral-striatal regions in positive mood.

Using microendoscopic calcium imaging in mice, we find that sex information is represented in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) across excitatory and inhibitory neurons. These cells form a distributed code that differentiates the sex of conspecifics and is strengthened with social experience. While males and females both represent sex in the dmPFC, male mice show stronger encoding of female cues, and the relative strength of these sex representations predicts sex preference behavior. Using activity-dependent optogenetic manipulations of natively active ensembles, we further show that these specific representations modulate preference behavior toward males and females. Together, these results define a functional role for native representations of sex in shaping social behavior, and reveal a neural mechanism underlying male- vs. female-directed sociality.",Shan Huang,Shan Huang; Lyle Kingsbury Lyle; Tara Raam; Letizia Ye; Don Wei; Rongfeng Hu; Li Ye; Weizhe Hong,"University of California, Los Angeles (grid.19006.3e)","Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 17:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 17:30:00+00:00,

recbLPqlcJqVqgLvK,Effects of the stress hormone cortisol on spontaneous activity in the larval zebrafish tectum,"Early life stress can have lifelong negative health consequences, but we still lack an understanding of the mechanisms that cause this. In the brain, exposure to stress during development is known to affect neural plasticity and excitability in the limbic system. The limbic system in turn is intimately interconnected with sensorimotor systems, which represent key stages in receiving information about the world and coordinating behavioural responses to environmental stimuli including stressors. Yet, how stress affects sensorimotor systems remains largely unknown. Here we used the optic tectum of the larval zebrafish as a model to investigate how exposure to the stress hormone cortisol affects processing in a visual circuit. Specifically, we hypothesized that cortisol would have an effect on tectal physiology and that we would observe differences in tectal population dynamics. We employed two-photon calcium imaging to probe single-cell resolution changes in activity during spontaneous (stimulus free) tectal activity before and after addition of cortisol. We applied machine learning approaches to characterise the dynamics before and after cortisol. Preliminary results suggest that cortisol significantly alters the population dynamics in the larval tectum. These results suggest that the larval zebrafish is a promising model for investigating the effects of stress on sensorimotor physiology and development. ",Elina Jacobs (she/her),"Matthew J.

recbLRZMtGl7LzE5B,Inference as Control,"Sensory observations about the world are invariably ambiguous. Inference about the world's latent variables is thus an important computation for the brain. However, computational constraints limit the performance of these computations. These constraints include energetic costs for neural activity and noise for every channel. Efficient coding is a prominent theory that describes how limited resources can be used best. In one incarnation, this leads to a theory of predictive coding, where predictions are subtracted from signals, reducing the cost of sending something that is already known. This theory does not, however, account for the costs or noise associated with those predictions. Here we offer a theory that accounts for both feedforward and feedback costs and noise throughout. We formulate this inference problem as message-passing on a graph whereby feedback is viewed as a control signal aiming to maximize how well an inference tracks a target state.",Lokesh Boominathan,"Paul Schrater, University of Minnesota; Xaq Pitkow, Baylor College of Medicine;",Rice University (grid.21940.3e),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-30 21:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 21:30:00+00:00,
recbNU7PcBCVc9ruV,Global Brain Volume is Associated with General Psychopathology in Children,"Childhood is important for the onset of psychopathology and for brain development. Psychopathology is characterized by considerable comorbidity, which is mirrored in its underlying neural correlates. Both common and dissociable variations in brain volume have been found across multiple mental disorders in adult and youth samples. However, the majority of related research has used samples with broad age ranges, which may obscure developmental differences. The present study examined associations between regional gray matter volumes (GMV) and dimensional psychopathology in a large sample (N = 9,608) of children (9-10 years) collected as part of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. A bifactor model identified four dimensions of psychopathology: a general factor, which reflects common variance across disorders, as well as three subfactors measuring specific internalizing, conduct, and ADHD symptoms. Brain volume was acquired using 3T MRI. Results from SEM analyses demonstrate nearly global inverse associations between regional GMVs and the general psychopathology and conduct factors, with significant associations for the ADHD factor as well (p-values ≤ .048, FDR-corrected). Sensitivity analyses including total GMV and intracranial volume as covariates further support this global effect, as region-specific results became non-significant, with the exception of the bilateral hippocampus. Sensitivity analyses controlling for income, parent’s level of education, and medication use as additional covariates yielded largely convergent results. Together, these results suggest that smaller brain volume is a common risk factor for psychopathology across disorders, and possibly for conduct and ADHD symptoms in particular.",Leighton Durham (she/her/hers),"E.

recbOn6i3DjroYbWC,Tracking Rhesus Macaque in a semi-naturalistic social enclosure (SNSE),"An open question in the study of non-human primates is that of relating naturalistic behavior to neural recordings or manipulations to better understand brain function. One way in which we can record naturalistic behavior is through markerless pose estimation. Advances in deep learning have largely improved human pose-estimation algorithms; however, tracking freely moving animals in naturalistic, three-dimensional (3D) environments remains comparatively understudied. The main challenge to successful pose tracking in non-human primates, such as the rhesus macaque, is attaining a sufficiently large and reliably annotated training set, rather than developing the algorithm itself. Here, we take advantage of two recently published training sets, OpenMonkeyPose and MacaquePose, to train a model that reliably tracks the poses of one to two rhesus macaques in a semi-naturalistic social enclosure (SNSE) with DeepLabCut, an efficient tool for high-throughput video analysis. Looking ahead, we aim to integrate wireless optogenetic manipulations and neurophysiological recordings to control behaviorally meaningful volumes of the primate brain in animals free of any physical restraint, permitting the causal dissection of the neural circuits that mediate naturally-occurring primate behaviors relevant for understanding social cognition.

recbRx70PieJj4pao,Visuomotor transformation in the multi-unit activity of the frontal and supplementary eye fields in rhesus monkeys,"Single-unit (SU) activity, the firing of one neuron under a microelectrode, has traditionally been studied to relate neuronal activity to behaviour. However, because neurons work in concert, there is an increasing trend in analyzing multi-unit (MU) activity: the average firing of neurons recorded within the vicinity of a microelectrode.  The goal of this project was to examine the spatial structure embedded in the simultaneously recorded MU activity of the frontal (FEF) and supplementary eye field (SEF) neurons. The spiking activity (visual, memory and motor) of these neurons was recorded during a memory-guided cue-conflict saccade task (where a target-fixed landmark shifted during the delay) by head-unrestrained monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Then, to assess if the MU activity carries the same information as the isolated SU activity, we used a model fitting approach on the MU response fields (RF) along a target (T) to gaze (G) continuum. Similar to the SU activity, the results showed that in both areas: 1) the visual (FEF = 88; SEF = 45) and MU motor (FEF = 90; SEF = 49) activities best coded for target-in-eye (Te) and future gaze-in-eye (Ge) coordinates, respectively. 2) Along the spatiotemporal domain (spanning visual-memory-motor activity), there was a progressive transition from T to G coding. 3) In the FEF, along the T-G continuum, MU activity better predicted the gaze than SU activity (p < 0.05), suggesting the robustness of population signals. In conclusion, these results suggest that: 1) neurons work in coordination with overlapping RFs and 2) the MU activity can be used as a reliable indicator of the visuomotor tasks. This has potential for translational purposes in medical settings to detect functional/dysfunctional sensorimotor transformations. ",Serah Seo,"Vishal Bharmauria, 2.

recbSARd5I4Ygc1ep,Optogenetic activation of the inhibitory nigro-collicular pathway evokes paradoxical contralateral orienting movement in mice.,"The current model for controlling movement initiation proposes that the basal ganglia (BG) plays a permissive role in the generation of movements through the modulation of the amount of inhibition on BG target structures such as the superior colliculus (SC), a key structure involved in orienting control. One of the outputs of the BG, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), contains GABAergic neurons that primarily project to the ipsilateral SC. The current model suggests that the removal of SNr inhibition, combined with excitatory drive from the cerebral cortex to the SC, produces contralateral orienting movements. This model of action is often referred to as the rate model, where the rate of inhibitory spiking of the SNr onto target structures is what determines the initiation of movement; high rates and inhibition results in no movement, while low rates and less inhibition produces movement. We tested this hypothesis by controlling the rate of SNr activity into the SC using optogenetics. Contrary to the model predictions, optogenetic activation of the SNr terminals into the SC of mice evoked, rather than prevented, contralateral movement. To determine how orienting movements may result from the activation of inhibitory terminals, we performed a series of slice experiments and found that the same optogenetic stimulation that evoked contralateral movements in vivo evoked post-inhibitory rebound depolarization and spiking in the SC output neurons. Only high frequency stimulation evoked contralateral movements in vivo and triggered rebound spiking in vitro. The latency of orienting movements relative to the pulse stimulation in vivo was comparable to the latency of rebound spiking in vitro. These results challenge the current dogma regarding the role of the nigro-collicular pathway in the initiation of orienting movements and may provide new understanding on the progression and pathophysiology of movement disorders associated with the function of the BG.",Claudio Villalobos Dintrans,"Michelle Basso, Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA",David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA (grid.471398.0),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 17:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 17:30:00+00:00,
recbUgfGXl1dhMbw0,Distinct synaptic plasticity mechanisms determine the diversity of cortical neuronal responses during behavior ,"Spike trains recorded from the cortex of behaving animals can be complex, highly variable from trial-to-trial, and therefore challenging to interpret. A fraction of recorded cells typically exhibit trial-averaged responses with obvious task-related features and can be considered ‘classically-responsive’, such as pure tone frequency tuning in the auditory cortex. However, a substantial number of cells (including cells in primary sensory cortex) do not appear to fire in a task-related manner and are often neglected from analysis (Olshausen & Field 2006). Even classically-responsive cells lose their stimulus representation during task-engagement without impairing behavioral performance (Otazu et al., 2009). These results suggest that non-classically responsive cells may play an underappreciated role in sensory processing and cognition. Recently, we showed that non-classically responsive cells recorded from auditory cortex and frontal cortex contained hidden task-relevant information while animals performed a frequency recognition task at levels comparable to responsive cells using a novel single-trial spike-timing-based analysis (Insanally et al., 2019). However, the synaptic origins and potential contribution of these cells to network function remain unknown. To address this, we developed a novel class of spiking recurrent neural network models that incorporate both spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP; Bi and Poo, 1998; Vogels et al., 2011; D’amour and Froemke, 2015) and FORCE learning (Sussillo and Abbott, 2009; Nicola and Clopath, 2017) to perform an auditory-guided task. We find that (1) this model recapitulates the surprising number of non-classically responsive cells seen in vivo and (2) distinct STDP mechanisms alter single-unit response profiles with heterosynaptic plasticity playing a key role. Finally, our model also makes strong predictions about the synaptic origins of classically and non-classically responsive neurons which we can compare to in vivo whole-cell recordings taken from the auditory cortex of behaving animals.",Badr Albanna (he/him/his),"Michele N Insanally, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Department of Otolaryngology, Pittsburgh, PA; Brian DePasquale, Princeton University, Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton, NJ; Saba Fadaei, New York University, Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, New York, NY; Trisha Gupta, New York University, Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, New York, NY; Madeline Albanese, Fordham University, Department of Natural Sciences, New York, NY; Kanaka Rajan, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Department of Neuroscience and Friedman Brain Institute, New York, NY; Robert C Froemke, New York University, Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine and Center for Neural Science, New York, NY;",University of Pittsburgh (grid.21925.3d),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-30 18:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 18:30:00+00:00,

There is a need to identify physiological changes that help explain this memory impairment. Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs) and associated replay events are potential candidates as they are the electrophysiological signatures of memory reactivation and consolidation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that SPW-Rs and replay events are altered following PAE. To test this hypothesis, we recorded single-unit and local field potentials from hippocampal subregions CA1 & CA3 of moderate PAE & control rats while they made laps on a linear track and while at rest on a pedestal. Preliminary findings suggest that replay and SPW-Rs are altered following PAE. Specifically, replayed trajectories are truncated and SPW-R frequencies are slowed. The results from these experiments provide a novel framework for investigating hippocampal mechanisms of memory impairment associated with PAE and may also provide potential functional biomarkers following PAE.",Ryan Harvey,"Ryan E.

We model this complex as a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. Using parameters from the experimentally determined range for both neuronal and network properties, we observe the dynamics of burst initiation, obtaining results that are also consistent with the experiment. Specifically, we examine the probability of burst initiation in response to the controlled stimulation of various numbers of neurons, as is measured by the experiment. Comparing the results of the simulation for different networks, we see that Erdős-Rényi fits experimental data significantly better than other physiologically relevant networks, such as a small-world network or the network with local coupling. Finally, we determine, using a combination of graph theory and machine learning, the structures of the network that lead to a global synchronization. 
To recover the stable oscillation pattern observed in vivo we use dendritic calcium adaptation, that mediates the resistance of the membrane. The oscillation phase appears to be robust, being stable under killing a large fraction of neurons, which is consistent with the experiment. This model, averaged with time is qualitatively equivalent to the firing-rate based model that was studied before. Outside of the steady oscillations phase, neurons in this model demonstrate separation on constantly high firing and low firing states explicitly breaking the mean-field approach to the problem. This separation occurs even for the all-to-all coupled network, thus providing an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking. For sparser networks, the clustering is influenced by k-cores of the underlying network and is exactly controlled by them in a particular limit of the model. We also analyze this separation using a combination of graph theory and machine learning identifying the properties of the network that determine whether it produces rhythm or experience phase separation.

recbxmPCdLlSPwAe5,Zebrafish exhibit visual attentional pop-out effects in their behavior,"Sensory inputs drive our interactions with the world, but the raw sensory inputs contain far more data than could be fully processed by our brain, which is constrained by limited resources. To overcome this processing bottleneck, the brain has evolved attentional selectional mechanisms to select only a fraction of the sensory inputs for deeper processing, and for survival this selection is often rapid and exogenously driven (“bottom-up”) so that it does not require any higher-order (“top-down”) cognitive guidance. Such attentional selection for visual inputs has been studied extensively in mammals, particularly in humans. To study the underlying neural mechanism for bottom-up visual selection, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) is perhaps an ideal model system. They rely on visual input for many behaviors early in development, possess evolutionarily conserved brain regions including a large optic tectum associated with attentional selection, and are amenable to live imaging using genetically encoded fluorescent indicators of neuronal activity. However, bottom-up visual attentional selection behavior has not yet been well characterized in zebrafish. A hallmark of the bottom-up visual selection is pop-out, when a uniquely featured visual item in a background of uniformly featured items, e.g., a red dot among green dots, elicits a rapid orienting behavior. Such orienting can be by gaze shifts (often in humans), and/or by turning of head, limb, tentacles, and body. We first demonstrate the pop-out effect in zebrafish using colored dot stimuli, and measure the orienting responses by shifts in the animal’s body orientation. We characterize the orientation response in relation to the sensory inputs, in particular the colors and spatial configurations of the dots. Our findings suggest conserved mechanisms of visual attention across evolution, and lay the groundwork for imaging studies to describe the underlying neuronal computations.","Sarah Stednitz, she/her/hers","Sarah Stednitz, MPI Biological Cybernetics; Jennifer Li, MPI Biological Cybernetics; Drew Robson, MPI Biological Cybernetics; Zhaoping Li, MPI Biological Cybernetics",Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics (grid.419501.8),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-29 13:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 13:45:00+00:00,
recc1zu1d2hzgcVyF,Predicting attentional engagement during narratives and its consequences for event memory,"As we comprehend narratives, our attentional engagement fluctuates over time. Despite theoretical conceptions of narrative engagement as emotion-laden attention (Bilandzic et al., 2019, Int. J. Commun.), little empirical work has characterized the cognitive and neural processes that comprise subjective engagement in naturalistic contexts or its consequences for memory. Here, we relate fluctuations in narrative engagement to patterns of brain coactivation, and test whether neural signatures of engagement predict later recall. First, in two behavioral experiments, participants rated how engaged they were as they watched an episode of the television show ""Sherlock"" (n=17) or listened to an audio-narrated story, ""Paranoia"" (n=21), by continuously adjusting a scale bar on a computer monitor. Self-reported engagement was synchronized across individuals, and the emotional content of the narratives was correlated with engagement when controlling for low-level stimulus features. We next analyzed functional MRI data collected as separate participants watched the same Sherlock episode (Chen et al., 2017, Nat. Neurosci.) or listened to the same story (Finn et al., 2018, Nat. Commun.). In these participants, group-average engagement drove neural synchrony, such that default mode network activity was more synchronized across individuals during more engaging moments of the narratives. Furthermore, time-resolved predictive modeling revealed that dynamic functional brain connectivity, but not BOLD activity patterns, predicted evolving states of engagement. Models not only predicted engagement of novel individuals within a single data set, but also generalized across completely independent samples. Finally, the same functional connections that predicted engagement overlapped with a validated neuromarker of sustained attention (Rosenberg et al., 2016, Nat. Neurosci.) and predicted post-scan free recall of the narratives, suggesting that engagement during memory encoding impacts subsequent event memory. Together, our findings reveal a robust and generalizable neural signature of engagement dynamics and elucidate relationships between narrative engagement, sustained attention, and event memory.",Hayoung Song,"Emily S.

recc3MO64oMnxmmOQ,The role of habitual behaviour in the corticostriatal pathway in a mouse model of Parkinson disease.,"The cardinal motor features of Parkinson disease (PD) typically, but often ignored, have a focal onset (Vidaihet, M. et al; 1994). However, the prevailing current Braak hypothesis about the beginning of PD fails to explain this important, focal and somatotopic pattern. Increased corticostriatal activity onto the caudal putamen leads to the perfect scenario for increased levels of α-synuclein to become toxic upon axonal dopaminergic endings (Foffani, G and Obeso, JA; 2018). It is noteworthy that corticostriatal stress in humans might be facilitated/mediated by continuous engagement in automatic/habitual motor performance giving rise to damage of dopaminergic axons in the motor striatum (Hernández, LF. et al; 2015; 2019). 

The goal of this project is to unveil the pathological role that habitual behaviour could have in the corticostriatal circuit in a mouse model of PD. To achieve this goal C57BL/6N mice will be used to anatomically define the cortico-striatal circuit of the paw. Then, α-synuclein pre-formed fibrils will be stereotactically injected in this area of the cortex to determine its uptake by dopaminergic striatal terminals. Finally, the role of cortical stress performed by enhanced automatic/habitual behaviour will be studied in these α-synuclein injected mice analysing the electrophysiological activity at the striatal level while animals perform a high demanding automatic/habitual task (FR4 lever press task).

We will describe the results obtained in the anatomical characterization of the corticostriatal circuit of the paw region in C57BL/6N mice.

recc5hASkhfhh2bCV,Plasticity Underlying Contextual Fear Memory in the Schaffer Collateral Synapse ,"The hippocampus (HPC) is a key structure for the formation and storage of episodic memory. It is reasoned that place cells in subregions CA3 and CA1 of the hippocampus, which exhibit robust location-specific firing, likely encode the contextual aspect of an episodic memory. Contextual Fear Memory (CFM) in rodents is a hippocampal-dependent example of episodic memory where a specific context is associated with an aversive experience. CA1 place cells receive spatial information from CA3 through Schaffer Collateral (SC) synapses5 and encode the context associated with CFM; in the case of the Inhibitory-Avoidance task on a linear track, this context is identified as the shock zone (SZ). We propose the synapses feeding into the place cells encoding the SZ are thus recruited to the CFM engram6 and participate in the different stages of CFM: acquisition, retrieval, and sleep-mediated consolidation. We hypothesize this recruitment of CA1 place cells to the memory engram occurs through long-term potentiation of SZ-encoding synapses. In vivo evidence of the synapse-specific modifications which recruit CA1 place cells to the CFM engram and mediate their activity during the different stages of CFM is fundamental to the neurophysiological understanding of episodic memory. This study aims to provide such evidence by measuring synaptic efficacy by concurrently stimulating Schaffer collaterals and recording responses in CA1 during CFM acquisition, retrieval, and sleep-mediated consolidation, and identify the plasticity recruiting CA1 place cells to the CFM engram through this key synaptic pathway.

Occupational Therapy intervention aims to improve the client’s occupational performance, hence there is a need for occupational therapists to assess the client’s deficits in areas such as cognitive, motor or psychosocial ability. Current tools available for assessing such deficits are not performance based or specific to skills required for occupational performance. 
AIM: To develop and validate a function-based assessment tool – the Functional Assessment of Motor and Process Skills Scale (FUMPS) in order to determine the specific deficits in motor and processing skills required for occupational performance, among clients with Acquired Brain Injury. 
METHODS: The study consisted of 2 phases. The first phase involved tool development and obtaining expert panel’s opinion. The second phase consisted of standardization of the tool. For standardization, the tool was administered on 25 participants with acquired brain injury by two different raters and at two different points of time for finding the inter rater and test retest reliability. For finding concurrent validity, the tool was compared with COVS and MOCA scores of the participants.
RESULTS: FUMPS was found to have good correlation for inter rater reliability for both the motor and process skill components (motor skill - Cronbach’s alpha 0.98 , process skill – Cronbach’s alpha = 0.99) between two raters and was also statistically significant (P = 0.0 for both motor and process skill). It was also found to have good correlation for test retest reliability (motor skill – Cronbach’s alpha = 0.99, process skill – Cronbach’s alpha = 0.97) and was also statistically significant (P = 0.00 for both motor and process skill). While assessing concurrent validity, the tool was found to have good correlation with MOCA (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.83), moderate correlation with COVS (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.78) and was statistically significant (P = 0.00 for both). 
CONCLUSION: From this study it can be concluded that the FUMPS is a reliable and valid measure for finding the specific motor and process skill deficits while performing functional tasks among persons with acquired brain injury.

reccOVgtzlwpWnLMG,Tools for efficient 3D cell and projection analysis and atlas registration of whole mouse spinal cord.,"The spinal cord (SC) contains a remarkable and complex variety of interconnected cells that relay and process somatosensory information and execute movement. Classic research on the embryonic and adult SC has identified major classes of neurons, based on embryonic markers, morphology and position within the SC. But recent advances in transcriptional profiling have revealed that the extent of spinal cell diversity far exceeds previous assumptions.

To achieve better characterization of spinal cell types and the detailed connectivity between cells that form functional circuits, it is necessary to map the spatial relations of neurons and projections. To date, however, unbiased approaches to map positional information in the context of the whole SC are severely limited by a lack of tools for efficient data collection and analysis. Moreover, the absence of a standardized 3D reference atlas for the mouse SC complicates anatomical mapping of data and comparison between samples and results across the field.

Here we present tools for practicable analysis of labelled cells and projections in whole mouse SC in the context of a novel 3D anatomical atlas. We have designed soluble, 3D-printed, ‘Spine Racks’ that guide oriented and parallel embedding of serial tissue segments of the entire SC within a single block for synchronous cryo-sectioning. Spine Racks precisely position tissue pieces within each block section array, permitting automated imaging of slides and rostro-caudal sorting of section images. Additionally, we have developed “SpinalJ”, a user-friendly plugIn for ImageJ, to register section images and to map the reconstructed data to a prototype 3D reference atlas. SpinalJ further combines various tools for manual and automated cell and projection analysis, as well as for data visualization.

We study stimulus coding in networks of spiking neuron models with spatially ordered excitatory and inhibitory connectivity.  The wiring structure is capable of producing rich population-wide shared neuronal variability that agrees with many features of recorded cortical activity. While both the spatial scales of feedforward and recurrent projections strongly affect noise correlations, only recurrent projections, and in particular inhibitory projections, can introduce correlations that limit the stimulus information available to a decoder.

This dissociation suggests that distinct computational and neural processes underlie these functions. Recent investigations have therefore sought to experimentally isolate metacognitive processes by creating conditions where perceptual sensitivity is matched but confidence differs (“matched-performance / different-confidence”; MPDC). Although MPDC has been successfully implemented in recent studies, much remains unknown about its underlying causes or how to best induce these effects in experimental settings. Here we developed a principled approach to comprehensively characterizing MPDC effects through analyzing metaperceptual (i.e., type 2 psychometric) functions relating objective performance to subjective confidence across widely varying performance levels and experimental manipulations. We found that MPDC effect magnitude depends on stimulus properties, observers’ sensitivity level, and critically on trial type order (blocked or interleaved across stimulus property variations). Our findings provide the first comprehensive exploration of MPDC effects, offer a prescriptive guide to quantitative metaperceptual analysis, and suggest optimal experimental paradigms for experimentally isolating metacognition and awareness in future studies.

reccVesJOTNQYWGdl,Oscillatory activity in the STN under PD: do we need to account for aperiodic broadband signal/activity and how it affects our data?,"Oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia is under extensive research as it may contribute to motor dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Most of the studies deal with local field potentials (LFPs), which are thought to reflect activity of neuronal populations in the vicinity of the macroelectrode recording contact. The power of oscillations may be assessed using power spectral density estimates in the range of interest. However, every spectra has aperiodic broadband component (commonly viewed as noise) that is usually not taken into account. Recent research (Gao et al., 2017) has suggested that this aperiodic signal may reflect the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) projections. Besides, the slope of aperiodic component may affect the amplitude of oscillatory peaks and skew the perceived power of oscillations when measured without slope extraction. We aimed to compare the power of LFP oscillations in several bands using the conventional method and the method accounting for aperiodic component. LFP spectra were recorded in the subthalamic nucleus of parkinsonian patients undergoing DBS surgeries in 2017-2020 in Burdenko Neurosurgery Institute. We performed LFP recordings at rest and during voluntary movement (i.e. fist contraction). We searched for the association between oscillatory activity in several frequency bands and motor signs of PD and their sensitivity to motor tests using both methods. Here we provide the evidence supporting the idea that aperiodic broadband component in LFP spectra may carry meaningful information about E/I balance,  though this aperiodic signal does not affect significantly the associations found for LFP oscillations and motor function in PD.",Elena Belova,"Ulia Semenova, Semenov Institute for Chemical Physics, Anna Gamaleya, Burdenko Neurosurgery Institute, Alexey Tomskiy, Burdenko Neurosurgery Institute, Alexey Sedov, Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics ",Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics (grid.424930.8),"Theme A: Development, Neurodegenerative Disorders and Injury",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 12:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 12:30:00+00:00,

In the superior colliculus of mice, there is evidence of a strong relationship between individual cell-types and orienting, hunting and defensive behaviors. Here we use this relationship to determine the contribution each collicular cell-type make on triggering behavior. We show that optogenetic activation of 4 different cell populations each evoked a distinct behavior, including freezing, stopping, hiding and orienting. Additionally, by combining optogenetics with functional ultrasound imaging (opto-fUSi) we mapped the neuronal activity in up to 264 brain regions and unraveled a few novel hubs engaged in defensive behaviors processing. Chemogenetic manipulation of one newly identified area, the posterior paralaminar nuclei of the thalamus (PPnT), revealed the role it plays in mediating habituation to repeated threat-like input from the superior colliculus.

recdAWRJQVE552qbE,Recurrent Neural Networks reveal distinct signal flow in mouse visual cortex following expectation violations,"A prominent theory in neuroscience has been the predictive coding theory, where top-down inputs provide predictions, which are compared with the bottom-up sensory inputs. Predictions are subsequently updated if they deviate from the actual sensory inputs (Rao & Ballard, 1999). To investigate the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie predictive coding, we need to study brain area interactions while animal’s predictions are violated. To this end, we used Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN’s) to analyze cortical layer and area interactions during a visual task, which involved expectation violations.

In brief, Multiplane Mesoscopes were used to simultaneously image 4 cortical depths of 2 visual areas (V1 and LM), while mice performed an image-change detection task. Three mouse lines, which were tagged for excitatory and two inhibitory subpopulations (VIP and SST), were used in our study. The behavioral task involved repeated and regular presentation of images (expected events), as well as the following two unexpected events: 1) infrequent and random omissions of the visual stimulus; 2) presentation of a novel image set after several days of training with a different (familiar) image set.

We fit the activity of units in an RNN model to the activity of individual neurons (Andalman et al., 2019) to study how unexpected events modify signal flow between cortical layers and areas. By comparing the weight distributions of RNN units, we demonstrate that functional connectivity between visual areas and layers changes following the presentation of novel images. Furthermore, functional connectivity was differentially modified for excitatory and inhibitory cell types.

Overall, our results demonstrate the use of RNN’s to investigate the cortical circuitries that underlie the representation and updating of prediction signals.",Akul Gupta,Farzaneh Najafi,Allen Institute for Brain Science (grid.417881.3),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-29 18:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 18:30:00+00:00,
recdQdixlC27JEWjK,A convolutional neural-network model of the human inner-hair-cell and auditory-nerve-fiber complex,"Analytical descriptions of inner-hair-cell (IHC) and auditory-nerve-fiber (ANF) processing have evolved
over the years, with IHC transduction models shifting from simplified low-pass filters to detailed
conductance models which include basolateral outward K+ currents. State-of-the-art models of the IHC-
ANF synapse complex describe the vibrations of the IHC stereocilia based on the mechanical drive to the
IHC and model ANF spikes or instantaneous firing rates as resulting from the depletion and
replenishment of different neurotransmitter stores. While such sensory models have progressed to
accurately capture the nonlinear and dynamic properties of the neuronal processes associated with
hearing, they typically comprise mechanistic descriptions and coupled sets of ordinary differential
equations, rendering these models slow to compute.
Here, we present a hybrid computational neuroscience - deep neural network (DNN) framework which
simulates auditory IHC-ANF processing, to offer a fast and differentiable model which can be used in
large-scale neuronal network models. Based on a state-of-the-art biophysical model of the auditory
periphery (including human cochlear mechanics, IHC and ANF processing), we trained several
convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to learn the computations performed by the IHC-ANF
complex (CoNNear IHC-ANF ). We determined the hyperparameters in these architectures (different layers,
filter lengths, input and context windows, activation functions) on the basis of well-known single-unit
IHC and ANF properties derived from experimental neuroscience studies. The model was trained using
an acoustic speech corpus, and its performance evaluated using basic acoustic stimuli which were not
included in the training set.
The final CoNNear IHC-ANF model offers a 70-fold speed-up factor on a CPU and a 280-fold factor on a GPU
when compared to the analytical IHC-ANF model processing computations. When connected to a DNN-
based cochlear model, preferably CoNNear cochlea , population responses (e.g. CAP, ABR wave-I) can be
simulated across a large number of cochlear tonotopic locations, and be used for backpropagation
purposes. Our auditory periphery framework can be applied for the development of large-scale neural-
network circuits aimed to advance our knowledge of unknown neuronal systems such as the brainstem
and subcortical pathways, or the human auditory cortex.

recdbwtBM94VXuOaK,Understanding transformations between “decision-potent” and “decision-null” representations in visual working memory using demixed PCA,"In the 2-back working memory task the representation of a stimulus item (n) transitions from memory probe (for comparison vs. n - 2) to unprioritized memory item (UMI; while n + 1 is compared to n - 1), and then to prioritized memory item (PMI; for comparison to n + 2). Inverted encoding modeling (IEM) of EEG voltage data (N = 30) revealed “opposite” reconstruction of stimulus representations as UMI relative to their reconstructions as PMI, suggesting that stimulus representations might be rotationally “remapped” with changes of behavioral priority status (Wan et al., 2020). Such rotational remapping has also been observed in the dynamics of a recurrent neural network (RNN; with an LSTM architecture) trained to perform this task. Moreover, only the PMI coding dimensions seemed to align with the dimensions relevant to the RNN's output, presumably facilitating its influence on the decision and response. In the current work, we use demixed Principal Component Analysis (dPCA; Kobak et al., 2016), a dimensionality reduction method, to better understand the representational transformations between UMI and PMI, both in vitro and in silico. Combining the advantages of traditional approaches such as LDA and PCA, dPCA can parse neural representation into a few components related to task parameters (e.g., stimulus, decision, and time), while capturing most of the variance of the data. In both EEG and RNN data, we are using dPCA to identify stimulus- and decision-dependent axes, to characterize how they interact with each other, and to track the representational dynamics along these dimensions as a function of behavioral priority. These analyses will enable us to distill essential mechanisms of how brains and RNNs dynamically transform working memory representations to flexibly guide decisions.",Quan Wan,"Quan Wan, Department of Psychology, University of Wisconsin–Madison; Jorge A.

recdfStituF0dmM5D,Social memory responses in macaque medial prefrontal cortex,"Humans have a sophisticated ability to understand other people’s behavior, in terms of knowledge about their personality, personal history, and internal mental states. This ability is thought to be supported by a distributed network of areas within the default mode or apex network, including regions of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To what extent is the neural machinery underlying these abilities evolutionarily conserved, versus uniquely human? Here, we search for potential homologues of human social reasoning areas in the macaque, capitalizing on the observation that in humans, these areas also respond to images of familiar faces. We record fMRI responses from four macaques while viewing images of faces and objects, that are either novel, visually familiar, or personally familiar. Across all four animals, responses to faces over objects are observed in multiple (at least three) subregions of mPFC and superior frontal gyrus. These regions respond over baseline to personally familiar faces, at baseline for visually familiar or unfamiliar faces, and below baseline for objects, indicating a domain-specific, memory-related response. The regions also share characteristic functional properties with socially-responsive regions of human mPFC: 1) They are positioned with the apex network, both in terms of anatomical location and functional connectivity; 2) They respond below baseline to non-preferred stimulus categories; 3) They have a characteristic anatomical organization across mPFC, with alternating regions of socially-responsive and non-responsive cortex spanning ventral to dorsal mPFC.

Such experiments are commonly taken to reveal that the neural activity is a representation of the stimulus. However, representation is a philosophical concept with a rich history. Within philosophy the concept of a representation goes far beyond correlation, typically implying semantically evaluable content and the possibility of misrepresentation. Here we summarize the standard investigative approach in neuroscience as well as the philosophical notion of representation as relates to understanding the mind. We point out how typical neuroscientific experiments stay well short of establishing what philosophers mean with representation. We then discuss approaches in neuroscience that rely on recording from much or all of an organism's nervous system, and approaches that use Deep Neural Nets to models intelligent behavior. We argue for a way that contemporary philosophy ought to be used to allow neuroscience to rework its approaches to meaningfully get at neural representations within these novel approaches.",Ben Baker,Ben Lansdell,University of Pennsylvania (grid.25879.31),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-28 12:30:00+00:00,2020-10-28 12:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/ohIt6LM7W3I
rece580qYij3J1UwA,Object Categorization and Response Bias Flexibly Change Depending on Cross-Spatial Scale Coherence and Task Demands,"Categorization of visual stimuli at different levels of abstraction relies on the encoding of relevant diagnostic features present at different spatial scales. We used the Eidolon Factory (Koenderink et al., 2017), an image-manipulation algorithm based on the scale-space representation of the early visual cortex that introduces random disarray fields across spatial scales. When the disarray is incoherent, edges become fuzzy and less defined; when it is coherent, the coarser scales dictate where the finer scales end up, leading to warping of the local structure of the image. With this method, we asked: is the brain using the global shape or is it detecting some salient feature to resolve a recognizable object? And, how is the correlational structure of different spatial scales interacting with the task demands? Images of animal faces, human faces and everyday objects were disarrayed coherently or incoherently to create a family of  50  eidolons per image with increasing disarray. Participants (N=217) viewed each family of eidolons in a smooth sequence from maximum disarray to none and performed a category verification task either at the superordinate (any face type) or basic (human face only) levels at different levels of uncertainty. In the first response, they used their gut feeling to respond, for the second response they had to be sure of their decision. When participants used their gut feeling to respond, we observed a basic-level advantage, but not an effect of the type of disarray. When they were sure of their response, we observed a superordinate advantage and stronger disarray effects in the coherent stimulus. Furthermore, participants changed their decision criterion depending on the abstraction level of the task. These results suggest that the visual system flexibly adjusts to the relevant perceptual information depending on task context and that it does not strictly adhere to feedforward processing.",Miguel G.E.

rece5ElpQrj6iz7pp,Visual ensemble representations emerge in Deep Neural Networks trained for object recognition,"Humans are able to quickly pool information from across many individual objects to perceive ensemble properties, like the average size of objects, the color diversity of objects, or even the gender ratio in a group of faces. Such ensemble perception in humans is thought to occur extremely efficiently and automatically, but how it arises in the first place is unknown. Does ensemble perception arise because the human visual system must solve many different types of perceptual problems, or are ensemble properties represented even in a system with only the goal of recognizing individual objects?  Here, we used an artificial visual system -- a deep neural network -- to determine whether the ensemble property of color diversity emerges in a network pre-trained to recognize natural objects (using ImageNet). We presented the network with new images that were completely different from its training set: images of letter arrays containing four colored consonants on a black background. The color of each letter within an array was drawn either from a broad sample of 19 colors (high color diversity) or a randomly selected range of six adjacent colors (low color diversity). The ensemble property of interest -- color diversity -- was therefore a summary statistic for the whole array and not recoverable from any individual element. We tested whether a ResNet50 neural network could distinguish high vs. low color diversity arrays by using the activations from different layers as input to a linear classifier (SVM). We found that the network was highly accurate at identifying color diversity, with deeper layers more accurate than earlier layers. This demonstrates the presence of ensemble representations for the first time in deep neural networks, and also suggests that ensemble perception of multiple objects can emerge even in a system only trained to recognize individual objects.

rece6taarJ5oYuMNX,Dopamine circuits driving the transition to habit,"Habits decrease the burden of decision-making by establishing stimulus-response associations that guide
automatic behavior. While this automaticity can improve task performance, it can also lead to
compulsive behaviors seen in substance abuse and obsessive-compulsive disorder. To understand how
initially reward-driven behaviors develop into reward-independent habits, I am investigating a putative
circuit underlying habit formation in mice. Specifically, I am testing the existence of a circuit long
hypothesized to connect the dorsomedial striatum (DMS; required for reward-driven learning) to the
dorsolateral striatum (DLS; required for habit formation). The hypothesis, built from previous anatomical
data, is that DMS neurons indirectly activate DLS-projecting dopamine cells via inhibition of the
substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). To test this hypothesis, I am using optogenetics coupled with ex
vivo electrophysiology and in vivo fiber photometry. First, I am characterizing the circuit connecting DMS
to DLS-projecting dopamine cells ex vivo using retrograde labeling, viral-mediated gene delivery, transsynaptic
tracing, and intersectional genetics. Second, I am testing whether DMS activation leads to
dopamine release in DLS in vivo. Finally, I will compare the activity and connectivity of DLS-projecting
dopamine neurons before and after habit training. My ex vivo data is the first functional evidence for a
polysynaptic DMS-SNr-SNc-DLS circuit. Surprisingly, however, my in vivo data suggests that DMS
activation alone is not sufficient to increase dopamine release in DLS. My work will not only help answer

rececltN6UpEJlkIk,Sampling-like representation of prospective locations during hippocampal theta sequences.,"Predicting the possible future consequences of actions is necessary for efficient planning. In volatile or partially observed environments animals can capitalise on representing the uncertainty associated with those predictions. Representation of and computations with uncertainty has recently gained support in a wide range of cognitive phenomena but whether and how uncertainty is represented in navigation and planning has remained elusive. Here we investigated the neuronal representation emerging in a  goal-oriented spatial navigation task in a neuron population recorded from the hippocampus, a region widely implicated in model-based planning. 

During exploratory behavior the hippocampal population activity repeatedly outlines the trajectory of the animal starting from its recent past towards its possible future positions within each theta cycle (theta sequences). Critically, during a single cycle the uncertainty is expected to increase systematically, thus providing an opportunity to identify how it is encoded in the population activity. We contrasted 4 alternative models: (a) encoding only the most likely trajectory (no uncertainty encoded); (b) encoding the uncertainty by sampling from the distribution of possible trajectories (uncertainty encoded across theta cycles); (c) representing uncertainty via the standard probabilistic population coding (PPC) or (d) via distributed distributional code (DDC).

By decoding hippocampal spikes falling into different phases of the theta oscillation, we confirmed that the location encoded by the activity sweeps ahead of the animal at late theta phases. Consistent with the representation of increased uncertainty, we observed that place fields were largest when estimated from late phase spikes. The population activity typically encoded single locations instead of full distributions with the firing rate being the highest when encoding future locations ruling out distributional population codes (PPC and DDC). Finally, we found that the variability between subsequent theta cycles is larger than that expected from encoding the most likely trajectory, and is consistent with sampling from hypothetical future trajectories.  

Our analysis, being the first to directly contrast alternative frameworks of probabilistic computations, also demonstrates that activity in the hippocampus represents uncertainty and therefore is well equipped to contribute to optimal planning.",Balázs Ujfalussy,"Gergő Orbán, Computational Systems Neuroscience Lab, Wigner Research Center for Physics, Budapest, Hungary",Institute of Experimental Medicine,"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 16:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 16:45:00+00:00,
recedBmwYmHFrnTuw,Application of Digital Image Analysis Methods for Quantifying Spatiotemporal Neural Dynamics,"Recent developments in the ability to measure neural activity with surface and penetrating microelectrode arrays have allowed for higher-resolution and higher-dimension measurements of neural activity. With the development of this technology also arises the need for analytical methods to enable interpretation of these measurements in the context of underlying neural dynamics and processes. We examine the application of image analysis methods such as histogram correlation and radial profile analysis, for quantifying the spatiotemporal characteristics of neural dynamics in both simulated and recorded data.
Neural activity can be highly nonlinear and nonstationary, particularly in response to electric stimulation. When analyzing nonstationary data recorded from cortical surface or planar depth electrode arrays, image-analysis methods may be helpful in comparing various spatial and event-related changes in neural activity detected by these electrodes in the plane of a recording array. Since these methods do not depend on time series data, they may have potential application for real-time feedback control of neural activity.
To demonstrate the application of image-analysis based methods in comparing event-related changes in neural activity we used radial profiles to investigate the state-dependent response to cortical stimulation. We used a data set of 67 paired pre- and post-stimulation cortical states recorded from iECoG signals sampled 100 ms prior, and after cortical stimulation from a patient with epilepsy. State-dependence was defined as the conditional probability that pre-stimulation states were similar given the corresponding post-stimulation states were similar. We adopted a criterion thresholds for profile similarity and found that 27 cortical responses were classified as state dependent. To assess the statistical significance of this result, we performed a permutation test by shuffling the order of pre-stimulation states. Under the null hypothesis (N=1000 permutations of pre-stimulation states) we found less state-dependent responses (with a mean of 13.8 and standard deviation of 3.3 across all permutations). The test gave evidence in favor of prestimulation context affecting cortical responses to stimulation. Thus, we propose that using image analysis methods for analyzing multielectrode data has the potential to reveal new patterns in cortical activity.",Afareen Jaleel,"Pawel Kudela, Institute for Computational Medicine and Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins University; William S.

recef26RGdtEeMJpd,Deletion of beta2-containing nicotinic receptors in striatal neurons leads to behavioral alterations and increased striatal activity,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are relatively less expressed by striatal neurons comparing to other brain regions and their expression by individual types of striatal neurons as well as their functional significance is rather elusive. According to the traditional view supported mainly by electrophysiological data, nAChRs are mainly expressed by striatal interneurons while the expression by striatal principal neurons (commonly referred to as medium spiny neurons, MSNs) is very low. Striatal interneurons represent only approximately 5 % of neurons in the striatum and they consist of a group of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) and several different types of GABAergic interneurons (GABAINs). In our study, we reviewed previously published single cell RNA sequencing data1 to investigate the pattern of beta2-containing nAChRs (beta2* nAChRs) expression by striatal neurons. Furthermore, we performed deletion of beta2* nAChRs in striatal neurons to test the effect of the deletion on behavior and neuronal activity. By examining the previously published data, we found no difference in the RNA expression level between striatal interneurons and MSNs. In contrast, the non-specific deletion of beta2* nAChRs in striatal neurons led to increased neuronal activity evaluated by Fos immunofluorescence, both at baseline and after induction with amphetamine. This suggests that the deletion mainly affected inhibitory GABAINs leading to increased MSNs' activity. In addition, mice with the beta2* nAChRs deletion in striatal neurons showed alterations in social preference test and increased anxiety together with mild cognitive alterations and hyperactivity. This behavioral phenotype is less prominent but generally in agreement with the phenotype observed in global beta2-KO mice2.

recerMKnpNfaSf6Hg,Comparison of Cortical Object Representation With Neuroscience-Inspired Deep Neural Networks,"      Simulation of human visual perception stands out amongst the most important purposes of artificial intelligence. Artificial neural network, a computational model of biological neural network, is assumed as being highly inspired by human visual representation. Thus, understanding the cortical object representation would lead us to ameliorate deep neural network structures.

       Understanding the mechanisms of representation of objects in visual ventral pathway is achieved by analyzing the responses of neurons across temporal ventral stream. Layers of a deep neural network are claimed to resemble ventral pathway; theories posit that the DNN first layers and last layers are analogous to Retinal Ganglion Cells and Anterior Inferior Temporal respectively. 

        The main focus of this study is comparison of stages of cortical object representation with neuroscience-inspired deep neural network layers with human object recognition performance. To this end, a dataset comprising of two groups of animate and inamitate line-drawings are divided into three groups: COMP, EDGE, and VERT. COMP group consist of intact line-drawing of animate and inamitate objects, while EDGE  and VERT groups are fragmented images of the same objects with only edge and vertex information respectively.  On one hand, the stimuli have been shown to sixteen 8 to 12 year-olds and they were asked to name the image for each of the three types. On the other hand, the stimuli were fed into a four layer CNN in order to compare their accuracies to human performance.

        The accuracy patterns of CNNs and human were exactly the same, whereas we expected them to have higher accuracies for CNNs on EDGE images. After visualizing representational dissimilarity matrix of images representations we concluded that, this similarity between human vision and modern computer vision is an inductive bias of DNNs.

recet8YEcwdOjH2y3,The Effects of Social Rewards on Incidental Episodic Memory,"Episodic memory is our memory for specific, personally experienced events. Although remembering the “what, where and when” of an instance may be highly beneficial, the brain’s memory capacity is limited and must therefore be selective. Rewards are important enhancers of episodic memory acquisition and storage. Among them, social rewards have been proposed as important drivers of motivated behaviour. Whether the benefits of social rewards on memory still operate on incidental (unplanned) memorization of neutral events has not been tested yet. In this study, we explored the effects of social rewards on memory for neutral scenes that were completely unrelated, except for proximity in time, to the sources of reward (here, the presentation of happy versus neutral faces). One day after the completion of an encoding task, participants were given a surprise memory test that assessed their recollection of spatial or temporal information related to such incidental scenes. Differences in memory for space versus time-related information were observed. Although participants were expected to have better memory for scenes that occurred after delivery of social rewards, this was not the case; possible explanations for this are discussed. However, strong interactions between the anticipated effect and participants’ mood were noted, and our initial hypothesis did hold true in a subset of participants who experienced exceptionally low mood on the day of encoding. These findings hint at the limitations of a reward-driven enhancement of incidental episodic memory and highlight the important role of mood in modulating the extent of such an effect.

recetgt1YZ65IgqLI,Quantifying dynamic stability and signal propagation: Lyapunov spectra of chaotic recurrent neural networks,"Brains process information through the collective dynamics of large neural networks. Collective chaos was suggested to underlie the complex ongoing dynamics observed in cerebral cortical circuits and determine the impact and processing of incoming information streams. While dynamic mean-field theory has uncovered key properties of recurrent network models such as the onset of chaos and their largest Lyapunov exponent, fundamental features of their dynamics remain unknown. In particular, chaotic dynamics in dissipative high-dimensional systems takes place on a subset of phase space of reduced dimension and is organized by a complex tangle of stable, neutral and unstable manifolds. Key topological invariants of this phase space structure such as attractor dimension, and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy so far remained elusive.

Here we calculate the complete Lyapunov spectrum of recurrent neural networks. We show that chaos in these networks is extensive with a size-invariant Lyapunov spectrum and characterized by attractor dimensions much smaller than the number of phase space dimensions. The attractor dimension and entropy rate increases with coupling strength near the onset of chaos but decrease far from onset, reflecting a reduction in the number of unstable directions. We find that near the onset of chaos, for very intense chaos, and discrete-time dynamics, random matrix theory provides good analytical approximations to the full Lyapunov spectrum. We show that a generalized time-reversal symmetry of the network dynamics induces a point-symmetry of the Lyapunov spectrum reminiscent of the symplectic structure of chaotic Hamiltonian systems. Temporally fluctuating input can drastically reduce both the entropy rate and the attractor dimension. For trained recurrent networks, we find that Lyapunov spectrum analysis provides a quantification of error propagation and stability achieved by distinct learning algorithms. Our methods apply to systems of arbitrary connectivity, and we describe a comprehensive set of controls for the accuracy and convergence of Lyapunov exponents.

Our results open a novel avenue for characterizing the complex dynamics of recurrent neural networks and the geometry of the corresponding high-dimensional chaotic attractor. They also highlight the potential of Lyapunov spectrum analysis as a diagnostic for machine learning applications of recurrent networks.",Rainer Engelken,Rainer Engelken; Fred Wolf;  L.F.

The PPC is important for the visual guidance of actions, and focal damage to this region can cause gross spatial errors when reaching to objects in peripheral vision. Individuals with AD, and possibly pre-clinical AD, might therefore be predicted to show impairments of peripheral reaching, but no prior study has examined this. Our aim was to characterise peripheral reaching in patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and typical AD, by comparison with age-matched controls (HC). A Peripheral Misreaching Index (PMI) was used to quantify differences in spatial accuracy between peripheral and free (central) reaching. Case-control analyses showed significant peripheral misreaching in a small subset of individuals with AD and MCI, but we found no overall differences between groups. Exploratory analyses revealed that reaching movements were slower and temporally extended in AD and MCI compared to HC, which is consistent with previous findings. Our findings show that, although gross spatial inaccuracy when reaching to peripheral targets is not prominent in AD or MCI, slowed visuomotor processing may be a characteristic feature of prodromal AD.",Alex Mitchell,"Alexandra G.

recf679EDzRMpKZRz,How do the blind ‘see’?  The role of spontaneous brain activity in self-generated perception,"Spontaneous brain activity has long been studied, but little is known about its behavioral implications. It has previously been hypothesized that spontaneous brain activity underlies unprompted (internally-generated) behavior. Here, we test whether spontaneous brain activity might underlie internally-generated vision. We test this hypothesis by studying the cortical visual system of five blind individuals who experience vivid visual hallucinations (Charles Bonnet Syndrome, CBS). Neural populations in the visual system of these individuals are deprived of external input, which may lead to their hyper-sensitization to spontaneous activity fluctuations. To test whether these spontaneous fluctuations can subserve visual hallucinations, the fMRI brain activity of CBS participants obtained while they reported their hallucinations (spontaneous internally-generated vision) was compared to the : 1) brain activity evoked by veridical vision (externally-triggered vision) in sighted controls who were presented with a visual simulation of the hallucinatory streams; and 2) brain activity of non-hallucinating blind controls during visual imagery (cued internally-generated vision). All conditions showed activity spanning large portions of the visual system. However, only the hallucination condition in the CBS participants demonstrated unique temporal dynamics, characterized by a build-up of neural activity prior to the reported onset of hallucinations. This build-up was most pronounced in early visual cortex and then decayed along the visual hierarchy. These results suggest that, in the absence of external visual input, a build-up of spontaneous fluctuations in early visual cortex may activate the visual hierarchy, thereby triggering the experience of vision.

recf8HTAI1qIrOLCc,Control over sampling boosts numerical evidence processing in decisions from experience,"Humans routinely sample information about alternatives before committing to a choice. However, the level of control over the sampling can differ: In some situations, the decision maker can decide what to sample (e.g., from which alternative) and/or how much (when to stop sampling), while in other settings, the provision of decision information is determined by external sources. Behavioral studies indicate that self-controlled sampling can modulate accuracy and recency biases in decisions from sequential numerical samples. However, the neurocognitive underpinnings of these behavioral effects are poorly understood.

Here, we recorded EEG while human participants accumulated numerical evidence about two choice alternatives (two-armed bandits). Before commiting to a choice, participants were free to decide from which alternatives to sample (partial control) or, additionally, when to stop sampling (full control). In matched baseline conditions, sample presentation was entirely pre-determined (no control; yoked conditions).

Behaviorally, we found heightened choice accuracy under full control, but not under partial control, compared to yoked baseline conditions. Unlike in previous work, recency biases were invariantly evident in all conditions under study. Turning to the EEG data, early visual responses (P1/N1) to the number samples did not differ between conditions. However, multivariate analyses revealed that the neural encoding of numerical information (cardinality, approx. 290-600 ms after sample onset), was enhanced under full control, mirroring the pattern in behavioral accuracy. Interestingly, this enhancement of numerical processing was not limited to late samples near the time of stopping, but was evident early on in the sample sequence. Consistently, we found a steeper ramping-up of late parietal signals throughout sequential evidence accumulation under full control.

Together, our findings indicate that control over sampling, and in particular over stopping, can enhance the encoding of numerical information in decisions from experience. The results replicate and extend previous findings of a neural numberline in multivariate EEG signals, and help understand the benefit of self-directed information search in human decision making.",Stefan Appelhoff," Ralph Hertwig, Max Planck Institute for Human Development; Bernhard Spitzer, Max Planck Institute for Human Development",Max Planck Institute for Human Development (grid.419526.d),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Interactive talk,2020-10-29 12:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 12:45:00+00:00,
recf8zA4jlm4iTgo4,Searching for a neuromarker of spatial attention bias in school-aged children,"Visuo-spatial attention is a fundamental cognitive function that enables us to navigate visual environments efficiently. We recently found that children at ages 6-8 exhibit a preference for the left-hand side of space over the right-hand side when allocating attention. Such leftward attention biases in children gradually diminished with increasing age (manuscript under review). In adults, a subject’s spatial bias indicates an asymmetry in attentional weights generated within the dorsal fronto-parietal attention network (also known as Dorsal Attention Network) to direct attention to the contralateral side (Szczepanski & Kastner, 2013). Thus, leftward biases in children may indicate a hemispheric asymmetry in the developing attention network, which gradually achieves a more balanced control of spatial attention as a function of age. To explore this possibility, we first searched for a neuromarker of attention biases in children by building a functional connectivity-based predictive model (Shen et al., 2017) with a priori regions of interest. We measured spatial biases using a landmark task in school-aged children (age 6-12; N = 37) and collected functional MRI data while children were watching a short movie clip. We identified topographic areas in the frontal and parietal cortices by using a probabilistic atlas (Wang et al., 2015), such as Frontal Eye Fields (FEF) and subregions along the Intraparietal Sulcus (IPS). We were able to build a model that successfully predicted each child’s spatial bias from connectivity patterns across the fronto-parietal areas. Using a whole-brain parcellation scheme (Schaefer et al., 2018), we found that spatial biases were predicted specifically from this attention network, but not from other networks. Future work using this predictive modeling approach to examine the development of the attention network will be discussed. Our study provides a lens to better understand the link between attention behavior and the fronto-parietal attention network in typical and atypical development.",NaYeon Kim (she/her),"Patricia Hoyos, Princeton University; Sabine Kastner, Princeton University",Princeton University (grid.16750.35),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Interactive talk,2020-10-29 21:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 21:30:00+00:00,
recfA1pLAAtooYQD3,Glutamate-to-GABA neurotransmitter switching induced by drugs of abuse and its impact on behavior,"Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse induces plastic changes in the brain that contribute to the appearance of drug-induced behavioral alterations. However, the relevance of some of these plastic changes and the extent of their behavioral impact have not yet been elucidated. An environmentally-induced form of neuroplasticity only beginning to be investigated in the context of drugs of abuse is neurotransmitter switching, which occurs when neurons lose expression of one transmitter and gain expression of another one, often switching the sign of the synapse and causing changes in behavior. 
To determine whether exposure to drugs causes neurotransmitter switching, we chronically exposed mice to either phencyclidine (PCP) or methamphetamine. These two drugs have different targets and mechanisms of action in the brain, but produce similar behavioral alterations such as cognitive deficits, hyperlocomotion and locomotor sensitization. 
We find that repeated administration of either PCP or methamphetamine induces a subset of excitatory glutamatergic neurons in the prelimbic cortex of adult mice to gain an inhibitory GABAergic phenotype, while losing the expression of the glutamatergic marker vesicular glutamate transporter 1. These changes occur in the same neurons as shown using transgenic mice in which glutamatergic neurons are permanently labelled by mCherry. To test the link between this neurotransmitter switch and drug-induced behavioral alterations we prevented the ability of glutamatergic neurons to gain GABA by injecting a Cre-dependent AAV expressing GAD1shRNA in the prelimbic cortex of vGluT1::Cre +/- mice prior to exposure to PCP. This treatment rescues PCP-induced cognitive deficits and locomotor sensitization, establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between the PCP-induced glutamate-to-GABA neurotransmitter switch and the behavioral alterations we have examined. 
We are now investigating the role of brain activity in mediating this neurotransmitter switching, as well as analyzing the downstream targets of switching neurons and other switching events at the whole brain level using Clarity.

recfDrRAhiVMb4F7S,Flexible operation of serial dependence in perceptual decision-making ,"Perceptual decision-making can be biased towards recent choices. In many cases, the recent past information stored in working memory is structured (e.g., a continuous attribute with a categorical behavioral-relevant choice). How exactly these information affects the dynamic decision process still remains unclear. We examined this ?attractive? serial dependence using a categorization task with auditory stimuli that vary along two attribute dimensions: gender (male to female, 5 levels) and syllable (?ba? to ?da?, 5 levels). We found that categorization of both gender and syllable exhibited a positive serial dependence on previous choices. However, the underlying dynamic process differed between the attributes. For gender, the amplitude of serial dependence was modulated by the similarity between previous and current stimuli, with participants more likely to follow their previous choice if the previous and current sounds were similar (and they responded more quickly in this case). For syllable, the dependence on previous choice did not depend on similarity between successive stimuli. With the drift-diffusion model, we further showed that in gender categorization, the past history (percept and choice) influenced the evidence accumulation, but in syllable categorization, the past choice mainly biased the starting point of accumulation. Next, participants were asked to rate how much the stimulus sounded male/female and ?ba?/?da?. We found that ratings of gender varied continuously along the male/female dimension but ratings of ?ba?/?da? showed a bimodal distribution. Our results suggest that during the categorization task, the continuous percept and categorical choice of gender are possibly both stored in working memory, but for syllable, perception is same as decision, both categorical.

recfHHacceSiM5Y3h,Optimizing spinal cord stimulation for bladder control using evoked nerve and muscle responses,"Bladder dysfunction is widespread and has a substantial impact on daily life, but effective management strategies remain elusive. Using neurostimulation, it may be possible to recruit the sensorimotor reflexes that control the lower urinary tract and thereby restore bladder function. Epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has clinical precedent for treating back pain, and we have previously shown that it can target the bladder by selectively recruiting lower urinary tract afferents. Additionally, we have effectively produced both inhibition and excitation of bladder contractions. However, the optimal stimulation parameters to evoke voiding or continence can span a wide space, including amplitude, frequency, and stimulation location, and these factors often vary between subjects. Here, we investigate the relationship of stimulation-evoked muscle and nerve activity with evoked bladder pressure changes. 

We placed high-density SCS electrode arrays (MicroLeads Inc, Ripple LLC) to stimulate the sacral spinal cord in cats. To record stimulation-evoked activity on lower urinary tract afferents, we placed nerve cuffs on the pelvic nerve, the pudendal nerve and its branches, as well as the sciatic nerve. To measure muscle activation, we recorded electromyographic (EMG) activity from the external urethral sphincter, external anal sphincter, and the gluteal muscle. Using a catheter in the bladder, we recorded changes in pressure. 

We extracted features from the nerve cuff and EMG recordings, including peak to peak amplitude, time of maximum and minimum amplitudes, length of response, and mean absolute value of several time bins of the recording. After performing a principal component analysis, we determined that it is often possible to distinguish electrodes that do not produce a functional response from those that do, as well as separate the continence and voiding responses based on neural activity.

recfHL9pkK6SUHwcM,Systematic biases in rare-event inferences,"When choosing between different options we often rely on information of non-uniform frequency and quality. For example, when evidence for one option is rare, these observations are of high quality, while evidence that may be abundant is often less convincing. Moreover, the information available to an observer is often limited, restricting the amount of high-quality evidence that may be obtained.  How do human observers make decisions in situations with asymmetric evidence quality, especially when the amount of evidence is limited? Recruiting over 200 subjects from crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk, we consider how humans approach these decisions with a task in which subjects observe a sequence of red/blue balls drawn with replacement from one of two jars with known ratios of ball colors. Subjects must infer which of the two equally probable jars the balls were drawn from. When both jars have ball ratios that favor the same color (one ball color is rare), subjects show a strong bias toward the jar with the more extreme ratio, even when evidence came from the higher-fraction jar. Notably, these biases are predicted by an ideal Bayesian observer.  However, many human observers show an enhanced bias in line with a Bayesian but not optimal approach. We have attributed this enhancement to subjects underweighing the information gained by a rare ball observation along with an overall preference for the more extreme response. We confirmed these results using model-free information theory metrics that showed a drop-off in the effective use of task information as subjects deviated from the ideal observer. Thus, our study yields new quantitative insights into rare-event inference, which is relevant to both real-world problems (like predicting stock-market crashes) and common laboratory tasks (like inferring rare state changes in dynamic environments).",Tahra Eissa,"Josh Gold, University of Pennsylvania; Kresimir Josic, University of Houston; Zachary Kilpatrick, University of Colorado Boulder",University of Colorado Boulder (grid.266190.a),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 22:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 22:45:00+00:00,
recfJwRXR2KyJ81Gf,A Bayesian map of the striatal microciruitry reveals different wiring processes for D1 and D2 spiny projection neurons,"Serving as input region of the basal ganglia, a set of interconnected midbrain structures thought to determine action selection, the striatum is mainly made up of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) which fall into two main categories based on the expression of either D1-type dopamine receptors or D2-type dopamine receptors. These distinct neuronal populations project into two different pathways towards the globus pallidus, but also make lateral connections which could constitute feedback inhibition of the circuit. In addition, interneurons in the striatum also connect to these SPNs. This complex microcircuitry is often overlooked in models of the basal ganglia which typically adopt a simple feedforward view of striatal function, when in fact, the connections between SPNs in the striatum could be crucial in determining their output to the globus pallidus. Fortunately for modellers, experimental studies to characterize these connections have been conducted and it seems that D1 neurons make fewer connections than D2 neurons and prefer to connect to other D2 neurons. However, the robustness of these results is undermined by the fact that when reporting these findings, experimenters failed to provide an estimate of the measurement error. We take the opportunity of correcting this oversight to introduce a novel Bayesian approach for estimating and comparing probabilities of connection. This method allows us to easily combine different data sets from different studies, to plug in the results of previous experiments in the form of a Bayesian prior, and to easily compare connection probabilities visually. By applying this method to two previous experimental studies, we find that D1 neurons do indeed form fewer connections than D2 neurons, but that evidence for preferential targeting by D1 neurons of other D1 neurons is currently lacking. We then go on to propose a method for extracting the probability of connection given distance between neurons.",Francois Cinotti,"Mark Humphries, University of Nottingham",University of Nottingham (grid.4563.4),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-27 12:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 12:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/nm2RLJwUXx4
recfVGGN1mLuV8DZw,Automated estimation of morphology of a neocortical neuron using in vivo LFP data,"New technologies are beginning to provide neurophysiological data at increasing levels of precision and at multiple scales including at single neuron and network levels. In parallel, advances in machine learning-based algorithms and architectures have spurred the development of several automated neural parameter estimation schemes. As an example, statistical inference can be combined with machine learning schemes to provide principled approaches that can integrate multiple data sources to handle variability, quantify uncertainty and incorporate prior knowledge. A specific instance of such a hybrid scheme is sequential neural posterior estimation, which combines the advantages of statistical and mechanistic modeling (SNPE; Goncalves et al., 2020)

We use the approximate Bayesian computation inference algorithm SNPE to infer the morphological parameters of a single neuron from multi-electrode in vivo extracellular voltage recordings. In this inverse modeling scheme, we designed a generic biophysical single neuron model with stylized morphology that had adjustable parameters for the dimensions of the soma, basal and apical dendrites, and their locations and orientations relative to the multi-electrode probe. The model includes simplified biophysics and had a module to estimate extracellular potential at desired locations. We used the SNPE algorithm with the single cell model to infer the posterior distribution of the morphological parameters, given the in vivo extracellular spike waveform of a putative rodent neocortical cell near the electrode as the observed data. Such an approach provides estimation of the morphology that best matches the spatiotemporal profile of the extracellular action potential recorded on a multisite silicon probe (Neuropixel). The next step will involve inference of the parameters related to the biophysics of the neuron, and may need to be performed iteratively with the inference of morphology parameters. Our long-term goal is to develop a publicly accessible toolbox that automates the process of inferring neuronal morphology and parameters from in vivo extracellular voltages.

recfVvfe30PBERkVq,M1 GABA relates to functional connectivity changes and retention in visuomotor adaptation ,"Interacting with our ever-changing physical environment requires continual recalibration of the motor system. One mechanism by which this occurs is motor adaptation. Understanding how motor adaptation is implemented by the human brain, how different regions work in concert to retain adaptive movement accuracy, and how this function is linked to metabolic use of neurochemicals poses an important challenge in neuroscience. In humans, motor sequence learning is related to concentration of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the primary motor cortex (M1). However, the role of M1 GABA in adaptation - where behaviour is acquired outside M1, but retained within M1 - is unclear. Here, we used an ultra-high field MR multimodal acquisition to address the hypothesis that M1 GABA and M1-Cerebellar functional connectivity would relate to retention of adaptation, but not acquisition of adaptation. As such, we demonstrate higher baseline M1 [GABA] relates to greater retention of adaptation but does not relate to adaptation-acquisition. This relationship is mediated by change in M1-Cerebellar functional connectivity: higher M1 [GABA] relates to a decrease in M1-Cerebellar connectivity, resulting in greater retention. These findings showed anatomical, neurochemical and behavioural specificity: As expected, no relationship was found between retention and a control metabolite, as well as retention and connectivity change between control regions and no relationship was found between M1 [GABA] and behaviour in a control condition. The implication of a mechanistic link from neurochemistry to retention significantly advances our understanding of population variability in retention behaviour and provides a crucial step towards developing therapeutic interventions to restore motor abilities.",Caroline Nettekoven,"Caroline Nettekoven, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, FMRIB, University of Oxford, UK ; Ned Jenkinson, School of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Birmingham, UK ; Charlotte Stagg, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, FMRIB, University of Oxford, UK ",University of Oxford,"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-26 16:15:00+00:00,2020-10-26 16:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/PzwQeRFMqQI

However, the interaction and blending of the two have been poorly understood. There is empirical and theoretical research on the circumstances under which these processes dissociate and align, yet a principled account of their interaction has not been proposed. In this paper, we present a computational model that formalizes the interaction between implicit and explicit attitudinal dynamics, and generates predictions of experimental explicit attitude measurement data based on these dynamics. We employ the Attitudinal Entropy framework by Dalege et al. (2016, 2018) to simulate implicit attitudes. To incorporate dynamics of explicit attitude formation and report, we expand the model by translating it into Bayesian terms, and use the Active Inference framework (Friston, 2010; Friston et al., 2017) to build a higher-level, (minimally) metacognitive module that assesses the real-time implicit level dynamics, stores memory of past assessments and directs self-report. Bidirectional communication among the modules allows to reproduce a variety of empirical phenomena related to self-report. Firstly, we simulate forced choice self-report for various settings that modulate explicit-implicit interactions, showing attitude strengthening effects under functional metacognition but not when metacognitive assessment is overconfident. Secondly, we simulate what happens on the implicit and explicit attitude levels when a person is forced to give a specific report (e.g., due to social pressure).

In primates, the occipital lobe performs the first feature detection steps, while computations required for object recognition take place in the inferior-temporal cortex, a region characterized for having neurons selective towards particular stimulus categories. In dogs, there is conflicting evidence that nevertheless points towards an organization similar to the one found in primates. Our aim was to describe regions in the dog cortex that process visual stimuli similarly to certain primate brain regions, including both low-level feature detection and high-level category selectivity. We hypothesized similarity between the patterns of activity in the dog occipital cortex and a model of the primary visual cortex (V1 model), and between the patterns of activity in the dog temporo-occipital cortex and a model of semantic organization (Category model).  We acquired functional magnetic resonance images while the participants (13 humans, 10 dogs) observed the videos of cars, cats, dogs, and humans. Using representational similarity analysis, we compared the activity patterns of different regions of the human and dog cortex with the two models (i.e. V1 model and Category model).

However, the NPH has also been long-known to comprise the oculomotor integrator which plays an essential role in eye movement control by holding the eye at an eccentric position in orbit after the saccade. Further, a study in non-human primates (Dale & Cullen, 2013), established that neurons in the NPH predominantly encode eye-related rather than head-related movement signals during both passively-generated and voluntary head movements. To date, however, it remains unknown whether neurons in the NPH of rodents encode eye-related and/or head-related movement signals. 

We hypothesized that NPH neurons in mouse, as in primate, preferentially encode eye-related signals during passive-generated and voluntary movement. Accordingly, we recorded the activity of NPH neurons with both with tungsten electrodes and/or 960 recording-site Neuropixel probes. Eye movement was simultaneously recorded with an AMR magnetic field sensor during behavioral protocols (Beraneck & Cullen 2007;Medrea & Cullen, 2013) designed to dissociate eye and head movement sensitivities (i.e.,  vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR), optokinetic reflex (OKR) and changes in static eye position). Our preliminary single unit recording indicated that neurons in the NPH of mice primarily output eye-related information during both passive and active head movement. Further, eye movement responses were nonlinear; modulation gain decreased with increasing eye velocity. Overall, our preliminary results suggest NPH neurons in mice mainly function to stabilize gaze, consistent with the non-human primate model.

However, the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal measured by Gradient-Echo fMRI is biased towards superficial layers of the cortex, which is a serious confound for laminar analysis. Several univariate and multivariate analysis methods have been proposed to correct this bias. We compare these methods using computational simulations and example human 7T fMRI data from Regions-of-Interest (ROIs) during a visual attention paradigm. The simulations show that two methods - the ratio of ROI means across conditions and a novel application of Deming regression - offer the most robust correction for superficial bias. Deming regression has the additional advantage that it does not require that the conditions differ in their mean activation over voxels within an ROI. When applied to the example dataset, these methods suggest that attentional modulation of activation is similar across cortical layers within the ventral visual stream, despite a naïve activation-based analysis producing stronger modulation in superficial layers.",Pei Huang,"Marta Correia, University of Cambridge; Catarina Rua, University of Cambridge; Chris Rodgers, University of Cambridge; Richard Henson, University of Cambridge; Johan Carlin, University of Cambridge",Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (grid.452264.3),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-27 10:15:00+00:00,2020-10-27 10:30:00+00:00,

Such data has been used to design data-driven models that can predict behavior from single neuron scale activity. However, today, these approaches often do not take the nonlinearity of the transformation between neural activity and behavior into account, and similarly do not consider how the connectome computationally enables the generation of this neural activity. We analyze the recently released data on freely moving C. elegans to demonstrate two approaches for attacking this problem: (i) we show that nonlinear models can achieve similar features as and better correspondence to held out data than linear models; (ii) we initialize connectome based neural circuit models and employ activity data to estimate activity in other neurons or the stimulus; we propose this as an approach for closing the gap between activity-based and connectome-driven models to move towards models that are more consistent with existing data and can generalize to different experimental settings.",Mehmet Kerem Turkcan,,Columbia University (grid.21729.3f),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-28 17:30:00+00:00,2020-10-28 17:45:00+00:00,
recfqBa6L6uNFSKjD,"Maintenance of refined visual receptive fields through BDNF-TrkB signaling depends on presynaptic GABA levels, not postsynaptic GABAA receptors or the scaffolding proteins gephyrin and PSD-95.","The development of visual response properties is thought to require early sensory experience, but our previous work showed that visual experience is not necessary, and spontaneous activity is sufficient for visual receptive fields (RFs) in superior colliculus (SC) or visual cortex (V1) to refine. Instead, juvenile visual experience is necessary only to maintain RF size in adulthood via a BDNF-TrkB dependent mechanism that preserves lateral inhibition. RF expansion significantly hampers visual processing ability of dark reared (DR) hamsters, and treatment with a TrkB agonist during a critical period rescues it. In this study, we investigated whether postsynaptic changes could underlie RF expansion in SC and V1 of DR adults. Dark rearing could interfere with the maturation of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) subunit composition, resulting in a higher α2/α1 (immature/mature) subunit ratio, compared to light reared hamsters. The α5/α1 (extrasynaptic/synaptic) GABAAR subunit ratio in DR adults might be higher than normal, resulting in lower phasic inhibition. Alternatively, dark rearing could reduce gephyrin localization at the synapse, reducing the stability of the synaptic GABAA receptors and consequently, the overall inhibitory effect of GABA. Lastly, dark rearing could also result in reduced synaptic accumulation of the scaffold protein, postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), resulting in reduced synaptic anchoring of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and AMPA receptors (AMPARs), potentially affecting long-term potentiation. Using western blotting, we found no significant differences between DR and normal animals in SC or V1 for the synaptic GABAAR subunits, or the scaffolding proteins anchoring the GABAA or glutamate receptors at the synapse. Our results rule out several alternative explanations for the loss of GABAAR function identified by our earlier work, and support reductions in presynaptic GABA rather than postsynaptic alterations as the primary explanation for the loss of RF stability in DR animals.",Parag Juvale,"David B.

The population of those over the age of 65 is currently doubling (Passel & Cohn, 2008). Contrary to aerobic exercises, open skill exercise has been shown to improve decision making, RT, and visual capabilities (Guo et al., 2016; Marks, 2006; Jafarzadehpur et al., 2012). Pickleball is rapidly growing and is recommended for older adults because of the court size, interaction, and is easy to learn, yet is moderate in intensity (Ryu et al., 2018). Pickleball can increase physical well-being and life satisfaction, but lacks research on cognition. We hypothesized that older adults who participate in pickleball will show improved cognition through perceptual learning. 
A non-experimental, longitudinal study was used to compare 83 healthy older adults. Groups were based on exercise characteristics (advanced pickleball-AP, novice pickleball-NP, aerobic exercise, inactive). A battery of eight standard and cognitive assessments (Multiple object tracking, Useful Field of View, Flanker, N-back) were given. 
UFOV. The aerobic and AP groups had quicker processing times. Older participants in the AP group had decreased processing times. As pickleball players age, it seems that the continuation of the sport can help maintain processing speed. 
MOT. The aerobic group was more accurate. The reason we may not have found the pickleball groups performing like the aerobic group is that these visual functions may take consecutive years and multiple methods of exercising. 
Flanker. The aerobic group had quicker RT. Playing pickleball more times a week can increase comfort level and familiarity with an unpredictable environment which could be why their RT was quicker.
N-back. In general, aerobic exercise can strengthen WM more than pickleball or that the N-back is not sensitive enough to assess changes in WM. 
Open skilled exercise can potentially maintain and improve cognitive decline in older adults more than traditional aerobic exercise. As the population of older adults grows, it’s important to maximize their quality of life and a game of pickleball could be part of the solution.

recfuQKcAVbAGlGFY,Manipulating a whip: the advantage of primitive actions,"Humans achieve astonishing dexterity, out-performing contemporary robots despite vastly different wetware (e.g., musculo-skeletal system) and software (e.g., neural information processing). We propose that this is accomplished by encoding movements based on at least three distinct classes of motor primitives --- submovements and oscillations for forward-path control of motion, and mechanical impedances for managing physical interaction. Composing movements in terms of parameterized primitive actions may be an essential simplification required for learning, performance, and retention of complex manipulation skills. To test this hypothesis, we focused on one of the most complex and exotic tools humans can manipulate --- a whip. We tested (in simulation) whether a distant target could be reached with a whip using a (small) number of motor primitives, whose parameters could be learned through optimization.
Regardless of the target location in 3D space, this approach was able to manage the complexity of an extremely high degree-of-freedom (DOF) system (54-DOF yielding a 108-dimensional state-space representation), and identified the optimal upper-limb movement that achieved the task. Detailed equations of motion describing the complex whip dynamics were not needed for this approach, thereby dramatically simplifying the complexity of the control task. 
Simulation results were in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations which indicate that human subjects use a small number of primitive motions to reach a target with a whip. These results support our hypothesis that composing control using motor primitives may be a key strategy which humans use to enable their remarkable dexterity.

A typically high static impedance is relied on to suggest an expected high dynamic impedance, and hence the need to correct electrode setup. Yet, the correlation between individual static impedance and dynamic impedance has remained elusive, with numerous prior studies suggesting it does not exist. This is a retrospective analysis of static impedance, dynamic impedance, seizure charge threshold, and patient demographic data recorded from a total of 90 patients (with a total of 622 ECT daily sessions and 622 ECT stimulations) involved in two previously published clinical trials.  These ECT courses utilized right unilateral (RUL) or bilateral (BL) montage placements, with either 0.3 ms (ultrabrief) or 1.5 ms (brief) pulse duration.

recg53XYzm7OLBOCb,Erasing Fear: Challenges for Decoded Neurofeedback,"Neural interventions in humans are either anatomically specific but invasive (e.g. ablations of cortical tissue), or non-invasive but with anatomical limited resolution (e.g. TMS). Most of these interventions are functionally non-specific. Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) is different: by leveraging fMRI and machine learning, DecNef creates non-invasive, functionally targeted interventions of neural activity. Aided by external reward, subjects unconsciously self-regulate targeted multi-variate patterns of their own BOLD-activity. Subjects self-activate patterns of neural activity indistinguishable from patterns corresponding to seeing images of some target stimulus type (e.g. spiders). Through trial and error and a sophisticated online readout of their neural activity paired with a reward system, subjects learn to create “spider” activity patterns in the absence of spiders. The clinical applications are promising. A popular treatment of phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder is exposure therapy, but it takes an enormous toll on patients who have to endure being exposed to their source of fear and trauma. With DecNef, because patients are unaware of the target, they can be *unconsciously* “exposed” to patterns of neural activity similar to those of their feared target effectively reducing their phobic symptoms without undergoing the emotional labor. Despite its promise for cognitive neuroscience and for the clinic, DecNef’s mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. This raises theoretical questions about our understanding of neural representations and neural intervention that I’ll discuss in this talk:

(1) What is the status of the neural representations targeted by DecNef?

(2) What kind of voxel-to-neural activity mapping can allow its impressive yet mysterious functional-specificity?

(3) Because of its underdetermined and potentially long-lasting effects (up to two months), can harmful or undesirable patterns of activity be activated unbeknownst to subjects.

recg95pkc0je4KDX2,No evidence for reduced precision-weighting of prediction errors in autistic adolescents' ERPs or behaviour during adaptation,"Predictive Processing accounts of autism posit that autistic individuals are less biased by expectations than those without autism when interpreting incoming sensory information, most recently formulated as stronger precision-weighting of prediction errors. Since precision-weighting is fundamental to all information processing, any differences between autistic and non-autistic individuals should be domain general and observable in both behaviour and brain responses.

 

The current study uses gaze-direction adaptation as a test case for the theoretical predictions. The current combined EEG and behavioural study with eye-tracking coregistration investigates whether increased precision-weighting of prediction errors is evident through smaller adaptation after-effects in the behaviour and ERP responses of autistic adolescents when compared to non-autistic peers.

 

Participants viewed stimuli used in previous studies (Jenkins et al., 2006; Pellicano, Ewing & Rhodes, 2013; Ward, Braukmann, Buitelaar & Hunnius, 2020) and responded with button presses whether they perceived the gaze direction as left, direct, or right. Ordinal multi-level modelling showed that both autistic and non-autistic adolescents responded consistent with behavioural adaptation (β = -1.49, SE = 0.16, z = -9.32, estimated p < .001), with no effect of group (β = 0.41, SE = 0.30, z = 1.36, estimated p = 0.16) or interaction between group and experimental condition (β = -0.18, SE = 0.18, z = -1.01, estimated p = 0.31).

 

Cluster-based permutation testing of the ERP responses did not show the expected larger reduction in the N170 or P2 components in response to adapted than unadapted stimuli, and no group difference was detected.

 

The current study is one of the first to take advantage of neuroscientific methods to test specific predictions from theoretical accounts of Predictive Processing in autism. Combined with the few other available studies, the current findings raise challenges for the theory and suggest no fundamental difference in precision-weighting of prediction errors in autism.","Emma Ward, she/her","Emma K Ward, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour; Jan K Buitelaar, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Medical Centre; Sabine Hunnius, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour",Freie Universität Berlin (grid.14095.39),"Theme A: Development, Neurodegenerative Disorders and Injury",Traditional talk,2020-10-27 09:15:00+00:00,2020-10-27 09:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/v0Xn_VqE8ro
recg9lE8K4W6uP24C,Disrupted Organelle Dynamics in Autophago-lysosomal Pathway in the Drosophila Models of C9-ALS In Vivo,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by preferential death of motor neurons leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. Although the majority of ALS cases are sporadic, a G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in C9orf72 is the most common inherited cause of ALS (C9-ALS). Since ALS displays selective vulnerability of motor neurons with cytoplasmic protein accumulation, we hypothesize that changes in intracellular organelle dynamics relevant to protein degradation pathway by G4C2 HRE may be a critical factor in C9-ALS motor neuronal degeneration. Here, we imaged Drosophila motor neurons expressing 30 G4C2 repeats (30R), and investigated the axonal transport of multiple organelles and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dynamics. We found that 30R expression reduces the number of axonal autophagosomes (APs), while it causes local accumulation of late endosomes (LEs) and lysosomes in motor axons. Interestingly, 30R expression led to a marked reduction in AP number within motor neuron synaptic boutons, and this deficit was not restored by neuronal excitation with TrpA1. However, the remaining APs in C9-ALS motor neurons underwent normal maturation and development to amphisomes upon successful fusion with LEs during their secure retrograde transport. Since axonal transport of mitochondria was not affected by 30R expression, we hypothesized that the impaired axonal transport specific to the auto-lysosomal pathway is not because of global disruption in axonal transport. Instead, we found the converted ER structure and impaired ER dynamics in 30R motor neurons by showing rigid ER knots and ER tubule discontinuities. Collectively, our results indicate that pathogenic repeats of G4C2 hexanucleotide impair auto-lysosomal pathway by affecting intracellular organelle dynamics, and suggest an important role of ER integrity in axonal transport relevant to auto-lysosomal function for neuronal proteostasis.",Hyun Sung,"Thomas E.

Multiple regression across temporal, spatial, and frequency dimensions revealed a spatio-tempo-spectral cascade from valenced RPE value represented by the feedback related negativity event-related potential (ERP) followed by non-valenced RPE magnitude and outcome probability effects indexed by subsequent P300 and late frontal positivity ERPs.

Millions of bytes of data generated all over the world to break the brain’s code, to understand inner workings of brain function and hope to find treatments to cognitive diseases. Seven brain initiatives launched around the globe, but no single initiative was able to tackle those challenges. In December 2017, seven initiatives came together and formed International Brain Initiative to combine their effort and accelerate the progress of neurotechnological findings.

All human behaviour could be understood under the illuminated light of this neurodata. Merging of brain initiatives also brings the question of who will capture this neurodata and how to maintain medical ethics.

Sub-components of behavior are organized by the brain, and are repeated and configured as required. The relative prominence of such sub-components across tasks and individuals provides a unique “behavioral fingerprint”, which can be leveraged to understand the underlying, generating neural circuits. Great progress has been made in decomposing the behavior of model organisms such as rodents, flies, and worms, yet progress for higher-order mammals such as macaques has been limited. This is particularly important, because (1) the behavioral repertoire of lower order animals is more limited, and (2) macaque models of the brain have a greater translational potential for humans. To this end, we hypothesized that during self-motivated behavior, macaques have a unique behavioral fingerprint that allows prediction of the underlying task. We recorded synchronized videos across 62 cameras of freely-moving macaques in a large, unconstrained environment under 3 different task conditions; a foraging task with depleting but predictable rewards, a foraging task with random and unpredictable rewards, and no task at all. From these, we reconstructed 3D poses using OpenMonkeyStudio, a freely available deep-learning software suite we have developed that leverages multi-viewpoint, marker-less image acquisition to reconstruct key body landmarks. Embedding poses across different individuals revealed iconic, sub-millisecond behavioral states. The organization of states exhibited both a local and a global structure; similar states were grouped closely together, and transitions tended to occur between similar states, even though states spanned a much larger space. Importantly, the specific configuration of behaviors – a behavioral fingerprint – was predictive of both the underlying task and individual.

Using simulations, we first show that this model can accurately recover time-varying synaptic weights 1) for both depressing and facilitating synapses, 2) with a variety of long-term changes (including realistic changes, such as due to STDP), 3) with a range of pre and post-synaptic firing rates, and 4) for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We also show the importance of tracking fast changes in synaptic weights, slow changes in synaptic weights, and unexplained variations in baseline firing simultaneously.

Although the performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs) can reach the human level on many specific tasks, the strong dependence on labeled data and uninterpretability have been hindering its development. In this regard, many methods were proposed, including the spiking neural networks(SNNs), which are considered to be the third generation of neural network. 

As a brain-inspired network, SNNs has the information transmission mechanism, the processing mechanism closer to the brain, and the lower energy consumption. In recent years, in addition to Hebbian learning mechanism, a supervised learning algorithm using backward propagation has also been proved. However, it does not exceed the effect of ANNs in practical application, especially in the field of target detection and target recognition. Our main objectives are as follows: 1. Establish a connection mechanism between ANNs and SNNs, analyze the differences between the two networks, and narrow the gap between the two networks in practical applications; 2. Extend the local unsupervised learning mechanism to the multi-layer network learning mechanism, and establish a deep network structure; 3. Solve the problem of 'vanishing forward-spike propagation' in deep spiking neural networks. we believe that analyzing the relationship between Leaky Integrate-and-fire (LIF) and artificical neuron model (AN), the basic units of SNNs and ANNs, is the key to solve problems.

Inspired by the Hebbian plasticity idea of learning synaptic weights from neuronal activities, we propose a novel learning algorithm called Feedback Propagation (FP) that uses a feedback network learned by the changes in the local activations. We show that this results in a local negative feedback loop that produces credit assignments in the global gradient direction. We trained deep, fully connected, and convolutional models on MNIST and CIFAR image recognition datasets with BP and FP algorithms and compared the performances and the learned representations.

Most studies are focused on targeting slow waves during NREM sleep, to improve memory consolidation. REM sleep plays a crucial role in emotional processing, which is essential for mental health. Theta is a hallmark of REM sleep, therefore detecting and manipulating theta waves could pave the way towards targeted interventions in clinical and sub-clinical populations. We present the first results on the development of an algorithm able to detect and target precise phases of theta (4-8 Hz), which could be used to further address how targeting can play a role on memory reactivation and memory consolidation.
Data of nine participants that underwent a night of polysomnography and EEG recordings in the lab. Ten minutes of recorded REM epochs from each subject were used to run the closed-loop acoustic stimulation (CLAS) system, targeting the 0-degree phase of theta.
   Targeting procedure involves an oscillatory phase prediction algorithm, based on non-linear sine fitting on the most recent data segment of unfiltered EEG signal. The criteria for stimulus release are: 1) The fitted sine is in a frequency range of interest, 2) The fitting error is below a given threshold & 3) The prediction is within a delimited future time window. The algorithm is implemented within EventIDE software (Okazolab). This method has been applied to the slow oscillation frequency range.
   Across all participants we achieved a mean target phase of 10.85 degrees (3.58 median), standard deviation of 56.74 degrees and made, on average, 163.78 predictions for each separate REM epoch. 

   These results on offline simulations suggest that it is possible to target specific phases of theta oscillations in a closed loop setup.

recgajdoTETGTfw7l,Mentation rate during resting state fMRI and trait depressive rumination: Is there a difference between depressed and never-depressed individuals? (A CAN-BIND-4 Analysis),"Trait depressive rumination (DR) is the tendency to dwell on the causes, meanings, and consequences of distressing feelings, and is a major risk factor for depressive and other psychiatric disorders. DR is usually assessed with the Response Styles Questionnaire, which has two subscales: Brooding measures the tendency to passively compare one's situation with an unachieved standard, while Reflection measures the tendency to engage in cognitive problem solving to alleviate feelings of distress. A conceptually related construct to DR is mentation rate (MR), or the number of discrete thoughts that one has over time. Little is known about how DR is represented in resting state brain activity measured via functional MRI (RS-fMRI) or if people who frequently ruminate also tend to have a higher MR or lower MR. In this analysis, a novel fMRI processing technique was used to objectively assess individuals’ MR based on the rate of simultaneous whole-brain network activity transitions (Tseng & Poppenk, 2020). This technique was useful for studying DR because it prevented metacognition about one’s DR from biasing the assessment of MR (e.g. via self-report).

Archival RSQ and RS-fMRI data from 88 depressed and 63 never-depressed adults, collected as part of the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network for Depression: Stress and Reward in Anhedonia (CAN-BIND-4: SARA) study, were used to assess DR and network transition rate (TR; a metric of MR), respectively. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the RSQ-TR association, controlling for age and sex: Brooding, but not Reflection, was associated with a slower resting TR, independent of depression status. This evidence suggests that individuals who report a greater tendency to brood in response to negative feelings also have a smaller number of discrete thoughts during rest, which may provide some explanation for why brooding thoughts tend to be characterized by repetitive thinking and dwelling.",Scott Squires,"Julie Tseng, Queen's University; Mojdeh Zamayadi, Baycrest Health Sciences Centre; Stefanie Hassel, University of Calgary; Stephen Strother, Baycrest Health Sciences Centre; Glenda MacQueen, University of Calgary; Sidney Kennedy, St. Michael's Hospital; Roumen Milev, Queen's University; Kate Harkness, Queen's University; Jordan Poppenk, Queen's University",Queen's University (grid.410356.5),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 18:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 18:45:00+00:00,
recgcqPMdvfHN95sk,BrainPrint captures stage-specific lateral shape asymmetry in autoimmune limbic encephalitis,"Limbic Encephalitis (LE) is an autoimmune disease often associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. It is categorized by serological subgroups, that differ in clinical progress, therapy and prognosis.

Our aim is to develop accurate imaging biomarkers for clinical and scientific implementation.

We investigate lateral shape asymmetry of an ensemble of 10 cortical and subcortical structures, by applying BrainPrint, a surface-based method that uses Eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on triangular (boundary) and tetrahedral (volumetric) meshes as shape descriptors. The intraindividual lateral shape asymmetry of each structure is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the shape descriptors.

We are comparing lateral shape asymmetry of patients with antibodies against the glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD, n=34), leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1, n=15), contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2, n=9) to age-matched healthy controls (HC, n=41). We divide the sero-groups by disease stage (time between first LE-associated symptoms and date of MRI) into an early stage (below or equal 24 months) and a chronic stage (above 24 months).

We find significant difference in the amygdala volume between the LGI1 patients of the acute group and the HC. Regarding the shape-asymmetry we find differences for the amygdala (LGI1 early), the hippocampus (CASPR2 early, LGI1 chronic), the caudate nucleus (CASPR2 early), the thalamus (GAD and LGI1 early and chronic) and the striatum (GAD, LGI1, CASPR2 chronic).

Our findings mirror the higher sensitivity of shape information as compared to volumetry. Since we already identified sero-specific features in volume differences in earlier studies, we now expect to refine those findings by adding information about shape. Our aim is to develop a decision tree classifier, so that in future MR-imaging analysis will contribute accurately to diagnosis, prognosis and description of progress of LE.",Antonia Harms,"Tobias Bauer, Department of Epileptology, University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn, Germany;Leon Ernst,Department of Epileptology, University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn, Germany; Bastian David,Department of Epileptology, University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn, Germany; Bernd Weber,2Institute of Experimental Epileptology and Cognition Research, University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn, Germany; Albert J.

recghyZtdlJomlCY5,The effect of familiar size on size perception.,"When interacting with the world around us, we use retinal size information to judge the distance of objects. It is known that this judgment is influenced by familiar size: a soccer ball looks farther away than a tennis ball if their images are equally large on the retina. On the other hand, when we lift a tennis ball and a soccer ball of the same weight, the soccer ball will not feel heavier, but lighter. So, familiarity has opposite effects on perceptual judgments of distance and weight. The effect of familiar properties on perception can thus be in two directions: assimilation or contrast. We here investigate how familiar size influences judgments about the size of images of objects that are presented on a computer screen. The images were about 5 cm in diameter, presented simultaneously 15 cm apart. Seventy participants had to indicate which of two objects appeared larger on the screen in a 2-alternative forced-choice discrimination task. The objects could be balls (tennis or soccer) or coins (10 eurocent or 2 euro). Participants also compared the images of the balls with a grey disk. The average precision of the size comparison was 3.5%, irrespective of the objects. We found that familiar size did indeed bias size perception: the size of the soccer ball was over-estimated by about 5% (assimilation). This overestimation varied considerably between participants. The bias in the comparison between the two balls was equal to the sum of the biases in the comparisons with the grey disk. The bias for the coins was smaller and in the opposite direction (contrast). We conclude that a depicted object’s familiar size can influence the perceived size of its image, but whether it is assimilation or contrast differs between experiments.",Jeroen Smeets,"Pauline Weijs, Eli Brenner",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 12:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 12:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/_Ft1ITDlT-w
recgjrylyhckzfs6K,EEG fingerprinting as a mean to bridging together the worlds of fMRI- and EEG-based neurofeedback,"EEG-based neurofeedback has been used for many years, with waxing and waning enthusiasm, because of the inherent difficulties in identifying its neurobiological underpinnings. Conversely, the field of fMRI-based neurofeedback is still at its infancy, and despite its many methodological issues, the localization power in the brain of fMRI has led to convincing results by targeting specific neuronal regions and networks. However, the economical and logistical constraints of NF interventions using fMRI hinder its widespread application.

A recent approach which attempts to bridge the two worlds of fMRI- and EEG-based neurofeedback is based on the identification of EEG fingerprints of localized brain activity as measured by concurrently acquired fMRI data.  This approach aims at transferring fMRI-based neurofeedback interventions to EEG setups, a strategy with the potential for high impact due to the low cost and portability of the latter, thus facilitating the dissemination of neurofeedback interventions in health and disease. 

Here we present our recent advances on this approach for deriving an accurate EEG fingerprint of the fMRI signal from the facial expression processing network. We show that by exploring EEG features from the non-linear domain convolved with a set of hemodynamic response functions peaking at different latencies, our method substantially improves the approximation accuracy achieved by state-of-the-art solutions.

It is know that its pathogenesis is multifactorial, despite not well elucidated. Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal model organism to dissect molecular pathways, here used to dissect the differential gene expression during AD’s progression due to the amylodoigenic pathway using RNA-seq. A total of 1388 genes were found as differentially expressed both as AD progressed and in control flies. The main pathways related to those genes were evaluated using fly genes and human orthologs, linking genomic and higher order functional information. We identified alterations in pathways related to metabolism, ribosomal pathways, proteasome pathways and immune system. Some of those genes were validated by qPCR and in vivo knockdown.

recgsVkIiHoDbPxa6,Computation-Based Feature Representation of Body Expressions in the Human Brain,"Research on body category representation, action and emotion has provided evidence that the brain is endowed with social perception skills. Yet, the actual visual processes that drive expression perception are still unknown. We went beyond research on high-level emotion representations to discover which mid-level body features drive automatic emotion perception. 
We computed quantitative body features from angry, happy, fearful and neutral whole-body movements. These features represented kinematic (i.e. velocity, acceleration and vertical movement) and postural (i.e. symmetry, surface, the angles between body segments and limb contraction) aspects of affective body movements. Using representational similarity and multivoxel pattern analysis techniques, we investigated whether the (dis)similarity of body posture and kinematics between different emotional categories could explain neural responses to body expressions in and beyond body-selective regions. 
Our results reveal six major findings. First, computationally defined features are systematically related to distributed brain areas. Second, postural rather than kinematic features reflect the affective category structure of body movements. Limb angles and limb contraction were particularly relevant for distinguishing fear from other body expressions and were represented in several regions including affective, action observation and motor preparation networks. Third, the posterior superior temporal sulcus differentiated fearful from other affective categories using limb contraction rather than kinematics, despite this area being known for its involvement in biological motion processing. Fourth, extrastriate and fusiform body area (EBA and FBA) also showed greater tuning to postural features. Although the pattern of feature representation in these areas was similar, the stimuli representation in EBA was very dissimilar to that of FBA, possibly reflecting their different roles in body processing. Fifth, kinematic and postural feature processing was not segregated into dorsal and ventral streams, with the exception of one feature: velocity. Finally, the brain representation of emotional categories showed a distributed pattern.

Our recent modifications to a carbon fiber electrode surface using a laser or blowtorch has increased the recording yield and adaptability of the arrays in the brain and nerve, respectively. Past carbon fiber electrode arrays in the brain exhibited both high fidelity single unit recordings and a healthy neuronal population immediately adjacent to the recording site. We recently showed that using a 532nm laser instead of traditional microsurgical scissors for the creation of the electrode site increased the recording yield to 84% after 7 days and 71% after 63 days of chronic implant with PEDOT:pTS coating (N=45 fibers) (Welle et al., 2020), compared to a ~30% recording yield for scissor cut fibers. The laser cut electrodes created a consistent, sustainable 257 ± 13.8-µm2 electrode with low 1kHz impedance (19 ± 4kΩ with PEDOT:pTS) and low fiber-to-fiber variability. To enable peripheral nerve interfacing, where the insertion problem is more difficult, we used a 3mm butane flame to create sharpened carbon fiber electrodes that successfully inserted through the epineurium of nerve and dorsal root ganglion without a shuttle. The sharpened carbon fibers were on average 224µm in length with 147µm of exposed carbon and a tip angle of 72 degrees (N=24 fibers). We recorded spontaneous neural activity from rat cervical vagus nerve (Jiman et al., 2020) and feline dorsal root ganglion structures. Discernible single units were detected in physiologically relevant experiments, such as brushing and bladder filling.

In the current study, first sought to determine whether there is a similar surge in mice by measuring plasma levels of copeptin (a proxy for VP) following either a vaginal or C-sectioned birth. We found that neonates experience a ≥ 50-fold elevation in peripheral copeptin levels compared to adult mice, and that these levels are significantly higher in mice born vaginally compared to those born by C-section. We also found that VP mRNA expression in the hypothalamus significantly increases during the days prior to birth, and that hypothalamic VP neurons are activated at birth based on cFos labeling. Additionally, we observed significantly decreased plasma osmolality at 1 and 3 hours following a vaginal, but not C-section birth, indicating a transient increase in water retention following a vaginal birth. Importantly, our lab has previously shown that neuronal cell death is significantly decreased at 3 hours following a vaginal, but not C-section birth, in several brain regions. We then established a detailed time course of cell death, showing a significant drop in cell death at 3 hours in the PVN, BNSTl, and LS. To test whether perinatal VP release may be neuroprotective, we performed intracerebroventricular injections of VP in C-sectioned mice 3 hours after birth. We observed a significant reduction in cell death in the PVN and AHA in C-sectioned mice that received VP compared to control. Overall, these data suggest that there is a surge in both central and peripheral VP which may be neuroprotective during early brain development. ",Jennifer Gray,"Yarely C.

But artificial agents lack generalist behaviors. We argue that general intelligence in artificial agents requires a knowledge-centric meta-cognitive approach. Meta-reasoning about next actions and possible next states is more than resource allocation and memory look-up, it allows people to direct their learning and interactions with world objects in a reusable way. Core to our proposed approach is the ability of finding natural decompositions in environments to understand and exploit structured knowledge representations. Our proposal is based on three main principles for solving complex tasks flexibly - natural decomposition and abstractions, interactions and composition of interactions. World environments are composed of entities and categorized by the types of those entities, in essence, they are knowledge graphs of underlying objects and their relationships. To solve tasks, the meta-cognitive process of the agent formulates a graph traversal path of which entities it needs to interact with locally and then solve tasks by composition of these interactions along the traversal path. Therefore, integrating these principles provides us levers and connect points to induce flexibility into the agents’ behaviors. The proposed meta-cognitive approach captures the essence of generalist behaviors and has promise to act as an enabler for artificial general intelligence with implications across domains.",Arun Kumar,"Paul Schrater, schrater@umn.edu, University of Minnesota Twin Cities;","University of Minnesota, Twin Cities","Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Interactive talk,2020-10-30 18:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 18:30:00+00:00,
recgzj5sYtAZERk0d,"A deep learning toolbox for noise-optimized, generalized spike inference from calcium imaging data","Calcium imaging is a key method to record patterns of neuronal activity across populations of identified neurons, but is only an indirect readout of neuronal spiking activity. Inference of temporal patterns of action potentials (‘spikes’) from calcium signals is challenging and often limited by the scarcity of ground truth data containing simultaneous measurements of action potentials and calcium signals. To overcome this problem, we compiled a large and diverse ground truth database from publicly available and newly performed recordings. This database covers various types of calcium indicators, cell types, and signal-to-noise ratios and comprises a total of >20 hours from 225 neurons. We then developed a novel algorithm for spike inference (CASCADE) that is based on supervised deep networks, takes advantage of the ground truth database, infers absolute spike rates, and outperforms existing model-based algorithms. To optimize performance for unseen imaging data, CASCADE retrains itself by resampling ground truth data to match the respective sampling rate and noise level. As a consequence, no parameters need to be adjusted by the user. To facilitate routine application of CASCADE we developed systematic performance assessments for unseen data, and we designed the algorithm such that .

Moreover, EEG and fMRI studies suggest that brain visual representation of low versus high spatial frequency is significantly noticeable. Recently, SEEGs (stereo-electro-encephalography electrodes), a technique used for invasive recording of brain activity via three dimensional recordings, have been standing out for its clinical applications in seizure surgeries. The high quality of recoding in SEEGs data gives the opportunity to combine Long Time Monitoring (LTM) with controlled stimulus presentation and investigate the neural representation of objects in human brain. Although, massive body of non-invasive imaging studies have been addressed the neural representation of objects in human brain, the neural representation of spatial filtered objects in human brain using intra-cortical recording is poorly understood.
During LTM, a pharmacologically intractable epileptic patient with implanted SEEGs participated in a face and non-face detection visual task. Electrodes were implanted in the right hippocampus, right and left supplementary motor area, right pre-supplementary motor area, and right anterior cingulate gyrus to evaluate an anatomo-electro-clinical correlate in the generation and propagation of seizures. The stimulus set is comprised of 155 grayscale images including 73 animates (face and non-face) and 82 inanimates at different level of frequencies to probe the selectivity of neural population across the five areas of the brain implanted by electrodes. 
Our results support the existence of distinct neural representation of different spatial frequencies for face and non-face stimuli within temporal lobe of human brain.

Studies in human subjects with profound BVL have proven useful in quantifying the contribution of vestibular sensation to posture. Generally, human studies involve the application of dynamic perturbations to support surface during stance. Analysis of the resultant upper body and head motion has demonstrated a shift from a platform-fixed to a head-fixed pattern of compensation around 0.5 Hz in normal subjects. In contrast, BVL subjects have difficulty with this platform-fixed compensation strategy. 

Notably, vestibular prostheses are an emerging technology that improves outcomes in human BVL patients, however continued work in animal models is essential for understanding the current functional limitations of the technology. Accordingly, here we explored postural responses to platform tilts in a normal monkey vs. monkey with profound BVL. Both animals were trained to maintain a relaxed posture within a behavioral chamber mounted on a 6-dof hexapod motion platform. Dynamic perturbations were applied to animal’s support surface in roll and yaw (0.25-10 Hz, maximum velocity 5 deg/s). The BVL animal received vestibular stimulation with a biomimetic transfer function in either the horizontal or posterior semicircular canal. A wireless IMU was placed on the animal’s head, and center of pressure, and joint positions (DeepLabCut) were recorded. Analysis revealed that postural sway decreased from lower to higher frequencies, similar to the platform-fixed to head-fixed strategy shift observed in humans. Further, the BVL monkey demonstrated a relative increase in sway at lower frequencies, which was mitigated by posterior but not horizontal canal stimulation. These results suggest that profound BVL causes detectible impairments in postural compensation, which is partially corrected by a vestibular prosthesis, particularly at lower frequencies.

Neural activity was measured bilaterally over frontal and temporal areas using fNIRS while participants completed computer-administered language tasks. Adolescents showed increased activity over left temporal regions compared to left frontal regions, independent of task performance, which was not observed in younger children.

rechO204z9I5ekhgX,On volition and consciousness in deliberate and arbitrary decisions,"The results of the Libet experiment have been interpreted as suggesting that the neural correlates of upcoming actions (and in particular the readiness potential) precede participants’ reported conscious awareness of the onset of their decision to move. Some have taken these results to mean that decisions are typically carried out unconsciously or even that consciousness plays no causal role in the formation of decisions. This, if true, may challenge some basic tenants of the notion that humans have free will and with it some key pillars of human social order—like moral and even criminal responsibility. 

However, these dramatic consequences depend on the neural correlates of upcoming decisions being decodable on the fly—online and in real time. We demonstrate such an ability from intracranial recordings in humans. Further, that interpretation rests on the idea that these early, supposedly pre-conscious neural correlates of action reflect decisions rather than mere stochastic biases. But our reanalysis of single-unit recordings in monkeys challenges that interpretation. Further, the free-will debate centers more on deliberate decisions (e.g., which career path to pursue) than on arbitrary ones (e.g., which hand to raise for no reason or purpose). Deliberate decisions are, speculatively at least, more related to consciousness than arbitrary ones. So, we compared arbitrary and deliberate decisions with nearly identical perceptual inputs and motor outputs, on the same subjects, using a novel donation paradigm. We found the expected readiness potential for arbitrary decisions but not for deliberate ones, challenging the generalizability of the Libet results from arbitrary to deliberate decisions.

More specifically, differences in neuronal activity in task-related brain areas (e.g. prefrontal cortex) and specific phases of information processing are predictive of correct/incorrect recall in related working memory tasks. Subtraction analyses have demonstrated that activation differs depending on the presented stimuli, suggesting that we can also decode stimulus information from the Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent signal. In this study, we analyse the published Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset, which studies brain connectivity in healthy adults. We focus on the Working Memory N-back task, with the specific contrasts: a high working memory load (“2-back”) versus a low working memory load (“0-back”). The already published results showed robust mixed-effects group-level activation in dorsal frontal-parietal and cingulate areas which are linked with working memory. Here we further extend the existing analysis by using non-linear models trained with parcels from different brain areas collectively to predict the type of stimulus. Furthermore, we investigate the role of certain brain areas in distinguishing stimuli by comparing specific parcels. Our analysis shows a close relationship between participants performances and categories of stimuli explained by response times. Our study also reveals that different types of stimuli have distinct brain signatures and a simple SVM classifier with a non-linear kernel can successfully decode stimuli with high accuracy in both Working Memory tasks. Finally, we train a GLM with samples from different brains areas and report that decoding stimuli success rate varies significantly, suggesting that some brain areas are more crucial in decoding stimuli in a working memory task, i.e. Secondary Visual Cortex, 96%(±0.01). *This study was conducted under the umbrella of NMA Summer School - Summer 2020",Nikolaos Chrysanthidis,"Nikolaos Chrysanthidis, Department of Computational Science and Technology, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, 10044, Sweden; Hande Tunbak, The Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, Rockefeller Building,University Street, University College London, United Kingdom; Keerthi Krishnan, Department of Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996; ",KTH Royal Institute of Technology,Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-29 16:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 16:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/njHHo8-km5Q
rechjOjxylSjsBgpy,A Tale of Two Trees: Modeling Apical and Basal Tree Contribution to L2/3 V1 Pyramidal Cell Orientation Selectivity,"Pyramidal neurons, a mainstay of cortical regions, receive a plethora of inputs from various areas onto morphologically distinct apical and basal trees. Both trees differentially contribute to the somatic response, thus defining distinct anatomical and possibly functional sub-units. To assess the latter, we modeled the complex response pattern of the L2/3 V1 pyramidal neuron to spatially tuned synaptic input. Our goal was to elucidate the contribution of each tree to the response pattern of the neuron. Towards this goal, we created a morphologically detailed computational model of a single cell, validated against electrophysiological data. We investigated the role of dendritic integration at the basal and apical trees, and its contribution in shaping cell responses. Results indicate that somatic action potentials are generated only when input coincides bilaterally, as unilateral stimuli are generally unable to evoke spiking activity at the soma. In addition, given equal synaptic drive, the responses of the neuron appear to be initiated by the apical tree, as its dendritic spiking activity temporally precedes somatic activity. Finally, basal tree activity, in the form of either depolarization or dendritic spiking, is essential for producing somatic activity, despite the fact that most somatic spikes are apically-driven. This model provides evidence for synergistic computations taking place in the basal and apical trees of the neuron, and emphasizes the role of predictive and attentional feedback input.",Konstantinos-Evangelos Petousakis,"Konstantinos-Evangelos Petousakis, IMBB, FORTH and Department of Biology, University of Crete; Jiyoung Park, Department of Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine; Athanasia Papoutsi, IMBB, FORTH; Stelios Smirnakis, Department of Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine and Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women’s H. and JP VA H., Harvard Medical School; Panayiota Poirazi, IMBB, FORTH",Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (grid.4834.b),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-26 16:30:00+00:00,2020-10-26 16:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/d0g8EpcIBWY
rechkDuHoywiIgOop,A multi-modal fitting procedure to construct biophysically detailed multicompartment neuronal models,"In computational neuroscience, multicompartment models are among the biophysically most realistic representations of single neurons. 
Constructing such models usually involves the use of the patch-clamp technique to record somatic voltage signals under different experimental conditions. The experimental data are then used to fit the many parameters of the model. While patching of the soma is the gold-standard approach to build multicompartment models, several studies have also evidenced a richness of dynamics in dendritic and axonal sections. Recording from the soma alone makes it hard to observe and correctly parameterize the activity of non-somatic compartments. 
 
In order to provide a richer set of data as input to multicompartment models, we investigate here the combination of somatic patch-clamp recordings with recordings of high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs). HD-MEAs enable to observe extracellular potentials and neural activity at subcellular resolution. We hypothesize that HD-MEAs may provide a valid alternative to conducting multiple simultaneous patch recordings.
 
To test this hypothesis, we built ground-truth samples from an available L5b cell model (Hay 2011), which was developed with multiple patch recordings (one somatic patch and two patches on the apical dendrites), and which is capable of reproducing properties of active dendrites. To do so, we extended the BluePyOpt software to use LFPy to simulate intra- and extracellular signals. We extracted features from both, simulated somatic voltage traces and extracellular action potentials. The extracted features were used to find an optimal set of parameters using a genetic algorithm approach.
 
In this in-silico study, we show that using a combination of patch-clamp and extracellular features allows for finding a much better fit of the dendritic parameters than the use of somatic features alone. This multimodal fitting strategy potentially yields a set of better constrained and more accurate multicompartment models.

rechnmF5jnXRzitpj,Age-related differences in brain regions linked to visuo-spatial processing during landmark-based navigation ,"Healthy older adults are impaired in their capacity to navigate efficiently which significantly reduces their autonomy and mobility. Behavioral studies have revealed age-related changes in multiple visuospatial abilities including the capacity to perceive and integrate visual landmarks for spatial navigation (e.g., a lamppost). However, the functional and neurobiological factors underlying the decline of landmark processing in healthy ageing remain insufficiently characterized. To address this caveat, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the brain activity associated with landmark-based navigation in young and older participants. 25 young and 17 older adults took part in an active virtual navigation task in which they had to orient in a simple maze using landmarks. Whole-brain as well as region-of-interest (ROI) analyses were conducted with a focus on high-level visual regions linked to navigational functions: the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the occipital place area (OPA) and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Results showed that older adults made more errors and that they relied on different navigational strategies to solve the task. Direct comparisons between groups revealed greater anterior temporal activity in young participants. In addition, only young adults showed activity in occipital areas dedicated to processing information from the central visual field. ROI analyses unveiled age-related differences exclusively in the OPA, with significantly higher OPA activity in older subjects. Overall, our results suggest that brain regions involved in the representation of fine-grained visual information may be disrupted in ageing which could in turn diminish the ability to use landmarks for navigation. This work helps towards a better comprehension of the neural dynamics subtending landmark-based navigation and it provides new insights on the impact of age-related visuospatial processing differences on navigation capabilities.",Marion Durteste,"Marion Durteste, Sorbonne Universités, INSERM, CNRS, Institut de la Vision, 17 rue Moreau, F-75012 Paris, France; Stephen Ramanoël, Sorbonne Universités, INSERM, CNRS, Institut de la Vision, 17 rue Moreau, F-75012 Paris, France/University of Côte d'Azur, LAMHESS, Nice, France; Marcia Bécu, Sorbonne Universités, INSERM, CNRS, Institut de la Vision, 17 rue Moreau, F-75012 Paris, France; Christophe Habas, CHNO des Quinze-Vingts, DHU Sight Restore, INSERM-DHOS CIC, 28 rue de Charenton, 75012 Paris, France; Angelo Arleo, Sorbonne Universités, INSERM, CNRS, Institut de la Vision, 17 rue Moreau, F-75012 Paris, France",Institut de la Vision (grid.418241.a),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Interactive talk,2020-10-27 10:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 10:45:00+00:00,
rechoB0WKga2o6Wdz,Do population differences in the human gut microbiome predict the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease?,"The human microbiome is a complex and dynamic community of microbes, thought to have symbiotic benefit to its host. Given the scale and complexity of the microbiome, it is not surprising that the current literature increasingly suggests a substantial contribution to disease.

Previous studies have identified influences of the microbiome on brain microglia as a mechanism contributing to neurodegeneration in conditions such as motor neurone disease and Parkinson’s disease. However, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), regarded as the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, remains a condition to be further investigated from the microbiome perspective. We further investigate this link by proposing correlations between population level differences in the gut microbiome and the prevalence of AD and other dementias within these regions.

Analyses were performed in R using microbiome and SIAMCAT packages using two large, open-access microbiome data sets (n=1006 & n >2000) (Lahti et al., 2014; Pasolli et al., 2017). Countries in these datasets were grouped based on AD prevalence and the microbiome profiles compared.

In regions and countries with a high prevalence of AD, there is a significantly lower diversity of the gut microbiome (p<0.0001). A PERMANOVA (p<0.05) revealed significant differences between several taxa in countries with high vs low prevalence of AD. Additionally, using machine learning, we were able to predict the prevalence of AD within a region or country based on the microbiome profile (Mean AUC 0.935 & 0.828). 
 
We conclude that differences in the microbiome between countries predict the varying prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias in these countries. Our results support a key role of the microbiome in neurodegeneration, potentially via its effects on microglia.We propose further steps to include experimental models to directly investigate causation between the taxa identified and the risk of developing dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease.

rechuo4bFi1DHqaTW,Hypothalamic Oxytocin Neurons Respond to Infant Vocalizations via Noncanonical Auditory Pathway,"Mammalian babies are “sensory traps” for parents. Various sensory cues from the newborn are tremendously efficient in triggering parental responses in caregivers. We recently showed that core aspects of maternal behavior such as pup retrieval in response to infant vocalizations rely on active learning of auditory cues from pups facilitated by the neurohormone oxytocin (OT). Release of OT from the hypothalamus might thus help induce recognition of different infant cues but it is unknown what sensory stimuli can activate OT neurons.
I performed in vivo whole-cell and cell-attached recordings from optically-identified OT neurons in awake dams. I found that OT neurons, but not other hypothalamic cells, increased their firing rate after playback of pup distress vocalizations. Using anatomical tracing approaches and channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping, I identified the projections and brain areas (including inferior colliculus, auditory cortex, and posterior intralaminar thalamus) relaying auditory information about social sounds to OT neurons. In hypothalamic brain slices, when optogenetically stimulating thalamic afferences to mimic high-frequency thalamic discharge, observed in vivo during pup calls playback, I found that thalamic activity led to long-term depression of synaptic inhibition in OT neurons. This was mediated by postsynaptic NMDARs-induced internalization of GABAARs. Therefore, persistent activation of OT neurons following pup calls in vivo is likely mediated by disinhibition. This gain modulation of OT neurons by infant cries, may be important for sustaining motivation. Using a genetically-encoded OT sensor, I demonstrated that pup calls were efficient in triggering OT release in downstream motivational areas. When thalamus projections to hypothalamus were inhibited with chemogenetics, dams exhibited longer latencies to retrieve crying pups, suggesting that the thalamus-hypothalamus noncanonical auditory pathway may be a specific circuit for the detection of social sounds, important for disinhibiting OT neurons, gating OT release in downstream brain areas, and speeding up maternal behavior.",Silvana Valtcheva,"Silvana Valtcheva, Habon A.

reci2r4AfF3wnvnI9,Saccade-related potentials during task-related refixation behaviour,"When a saccade is planned, attention shifts to the subsequent fixation location before the saccade is executed. In a free viewing task, this attention shift is biased by higher-order processes related to the task. We used EEG to study the dependence of pre-saccadic attention shifts on task-related processes. The EEG activity in the interval preceding a saccade is known as the saccade-related potential (SRP). We studied SRPs in a visual search task requiring memorization of multiple targets for subsequent change detection. Such a complex task naturally leads to refixations, i.e. the eyes returning to previously visited locations, depending on the task-relevance of the fixated item. We compared SRPs between first fixations and refixations for task-relevant (target) and task-irrelevant (distractor) items. Both task-relevance and type of fixation (first fixation vs refixation) affect working memory load, which biases pre-saccadic attention. Fixations on targets load working memory with both identity and location information, whereas fixations on distractors load working memory only with identity information. Higher working memory load is also observed in our task during first fixations, which are made for memorization of a new target in comparison to refixations, which are made for rehearsal of previously fixated items. First fixations had longer durations than refixations indicating a difference in pre-saccadic attention. Consistent with this finding, we observed an effect of both task-relevance and fixation type on the SRP in the interval preceding the saccade away from a target but we found no such effect for distractors. Higher SRP amplitudes were seen in the occipital region for first fixations than refixations with the opposite effect in the frontal region. Our results provide neurophysiological evidence for the effect of task-relevance and working memory load refixation on saccade planning.

We employed genetic, physiological, and metabolomic methods to examine microglial involvement in the regulation of wakefulness and sleep. Microglial depletion decreased stable nighttime wakefulness in mice by increasing transitions between wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Metabolomic analysis revealed that the diurnal variation of the brain ceramide disappeared in microglia-depleted mice. Ceramide preferentially influenced microglia in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), and local depletion of TRN microglia produced similar impaired wakefulness. Chemogenetic manipulations of anterior TRN neurons showed that they regulated transitions between wakefulness and NREM sleep. Their firing capacity was suppressed by both microglial depletion and added ceramide. In microglia-depleted mice, activating anterior TRN neurons or inhibiting ceramide production both restored stable wakefulness.

        In teaching neuroscience, some beginning students have difficulties in understanding some mathematical objects, such as multivariate Gaussians, where interactive visualizations could empower them with the intuition to overcome the learning obstacle in a simplified way. Such demonstrations might also help communication of neuroscience ideas to the public. 
        For maximal flexibility and to facilitate future open source development work, we would like to mix different frameworks, ranging from embedded GIFs to Python widgets to 3D Unity games. Thus we propose to present visualizations as webpages with components hosted by game servers. So far we have provided interactive visualizations in Godot 2D & 3D engine that uses a python-alike programming language, as well as the Unity3D engine in C#. Then, for further context, we link the interactive visualization games’ web window into Jupyter notebooks, and add video and/or scientific Markdown for explanations of the content. Consequently, people can choose and embed specific visualizations into their Jupyter notebooks and PowerPoint slides.
	We have developed the prototype versions of two Gaussian widgets (2D and 3D), a head-orientation activity altering neuron visualization, and a linear dynamics state evolution visualization. We also developed intuitive on-screen gestures to interact with the mathematical content, which could be used on multi-touch devices including laptops, tablets, and mobile screens.
        In conclusion, we develop neuroscience interactive visualization games to help students turn abstract mathematical concepts into pictures, connect them to model parameters and the outputs of dynamic interactive models, and help them build intuition and understanding.

reci9suyjd0xoiuRZ,Classification of Successful Sensorimotor Adaptation in Locomotion,"Introduction: Split-belt walking could serve as an intervention to correct hemiparetic gait due to brain lesions, such as stroke. However, not all participants respond similarly to the same split-belt protocol and it is unclear how to tailor the split-belt training for a given individual. Thus, there is a basic science and clinical interest to predict if a given protocol will be successful for a specific subject. 

Methods: We applied classification algorithms on an assembled large dataset (N=690 samples) of split-belt experiments to identify subject demographics (e.g., age, BMI, etc.) and protocol details (e.g., length of training, walking speed, etc.) strongly influencing whether a specific protocol would result in “good” or “poor” sensorimotor adaptation for a given individual.  A numerical approach was taken where many classifiers were trained and tested (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, etc.) on different subsets of the database with different model parameters. Performance metrics were computed (e.g., precision, recall, etc.) for each classifier type, subset of the data, and parameters for the classifier. For the performance metrics mentioned, a value closer to one indicates better classification performance than a value closer to zero. 

Results: The best and most robust classifiers (e.g., consistent and high performance across different subsets of the data) had acceptably good performance as indicated by an average classification accuracy of 85% (average precision = 0.93, average recall = 0.81). Of the features used, baseline gait asymmetry (even for non-clinical subjects) and belt speed difference, rather than belt speed ratio, were identified as important for predicting a protocol’s success. 

Conclusion: This work suggests that machine learning tools could be used to guide subject-specific rehabilitation interventions.

Fragility predicts 43/47 surgical failures with an overall prediction accuracy of 76%, compared to the accuracy of clinicians being 48% (successful outcomes).

reciRzghV1EkQQJR0,The time-course of prediction formation and revision in human visual motion processing,"Establishing the real-time position of a moving object poses a challenge to the visual system due to neural processing delays. While sensory information is travelling through the visual hierarchy, the object continues moving and information about its position becomes outdated. By extrapolating the position of a moving object along its trajectory, predictive mechanisms might effectively decrease the processing time associated with these objects. 
 Here, we use time-resolved decoding of electroencephalographic (EEG) data from an apparent motion paradigm to demonstrate the interaction of two separate predictive mechanisms. First, we reveal predictive latency advantages for position representations as soon as the second object in an apparent motion sequence – even before the stimulus contains any physical motion energy. This is consistent with the existence of omni-directional, within-layer waves of sub-threshold activity that bring neurons coding for adjacent positions closer to their firing threshold, thereby reducing the processing time of the second stimulus in one of those positions. Second, we show that an additional direction-specific latency advantage emerges from the third sequence position onward, once the direction of the apparent motion stimulus is uniquely determined. Because the receptive fields of early visual areas are too small to encompass sequential apparent motion positions (as evidenced by the lack of latency modulation for the second stimulus position), this latency advantage most likely arises from descending predictions from higher to lower visual areas through feedback connections. Finally, we reveal that the same predictive activation that facilitates the processing of the object in its expected position needs to be overcome when the object’s trajectory unexpectedly reverses, causing an additional latency disadvantage for stimuli that violate predictions. Altogether, our results suggest that two complementary mechanisms interact to form and revise predictions in visual motion processing, modulating the latencies of neural position representations at different levels of visual processing.",Tessel Blom,"Stefan Bode, University of Melbourne; Hinze Hogendoorn, University of Melbourne",University of Melbourne,"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-29 12:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 12:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/gWe66GRLPx4
reciXie9oICYEtNv4,Citric Acid Water as an Alternative to Water Restriction  for High-Yield Mouse Behavior,"Powerful neural measurement and perturbation tools have positioned mice as an ideal species for probing the neural circuit mechanisms of cognition. Crucial to this success is the ability to motivate animals to perform specific behaviors. One successful strategy is to restrict their water intake, rewarding them with water during a behavioral task. However, water restriction requires rigorous monitoring of animals’ health and hydration status, and can be challenging for some mice. 
We present an alternative that allows mice more control over their water intake: free home-cage access to water, made slightly sour by a small amount of citric acid (CA). In a previous study, rats with free access to CA water readily performed a behavioral task for water rewards, although completing fewer trials than under water restriction (Reinagel, 2018). We here extend this approach to mice and confirm its robustness across multiple laboratories. 
Mice reduced their intake of CA water while maintaining healthy weights. Continuous home-cage access to CA water only subtly impacted their willingness to perform a decision-making task, in which they were rewarded with sweetened water. When free CA water was used instead of water restriction only on weekends, learning and decision-making behavior were unaffected. CA water is thus a promising alternative to water restriction, allowing animals more control over their water intake without interfering with behavioral performance.

However, kinematic and dynamic analyses of such objects have been reported only for simplified tasks reduced to mass-spring or cart-pendulum systems. To advance understanding of how complex objects are controlled, this study examined human manipulation of an object with complex internal dynamics, a bullwhip. 
16 participants used a 1.60m-long whip to hit a target in discrete style, with pauses between successive throws, and in rhythmic style, where the whip never came to rest between throws. Data recording of the fast and complex whip motions required customized markers and faithful reconstruction of the continuous whip necessitated physics-based gap filling and cubic-spline interpolation. 
Participants’ performance was evaluated by the minimum distance between the whip and the target. As the whip could reach the target with any point between its markers, the whip was interpolated applying cubic splines between each pair of adjacent markers. Spline arc lengths were constrained to stay constant as the markers were fixed on the whip. 
Given the importance of whip motion for understanding human control, speed profiles of the whip were compared with a model of an unfolding 1D-thread with momentum conserved. Preliminary results showed similar sequence of speed profiles along the modeled thread as in the real whip. According to this metric, whip motion showed smoother unfolding in the rhythmic style. 
Investigating complex tasks not only poses a challenge to human motor dexterity, but also to the researcher’s computational methods, requiring innovative techniques for collecting and analyzing the data. The present study improved recording methods to set the stage for further investigation of how humans control flexible, underactuated objects.

It is generally assumed that by 2 months of age adult-born neurons are mature and equivalent to the broader neuronal population, raising questions of how they might contribute to hippocampal function in old age when neurogenesis has declined. However, few have examined adult-born neurons beyond the critical period, or directly compared them to neurons born in infancy. Here, we used a retrovirus to visualize functionally-relevant morphological features of 2- to 24-week-old adult-born neurons in male rats. From 2-7 weeks neurons grew and attained a relatively mature phenotype. However, several features of 7-week-old neurons suggested a later wave of growth: these neurons had larger nuclei, thicker dendrites and more dendritic filopodia than all other groups. Indeed, between 7-24 weeks, adult-born neurons gained additional dendritic branches, grew a 2nd primary dendrite, acquired more mushroom spines and had enlarged mossy fiber presynaptic terminals. Compared to neonatally-born neurons, old adult-born neurons had greater spine density, larger presynaptic terminals, and more putative efferent filopodial contacts onto inhibitory neurons. By integrating rates of cell birth and growth across the lifespan, we estimate that adult neurogenesis ultimately produces half of the cells and the majority of spines in the dentate gyrus. Critically, protracted development contributes to the plasticity of the hippocampus through to the end of life, even after cell production declines.

However, due to diverse cognitive dysfunctions and related neural correlates in ADHD, results are non-converging showing lack of reliability. To resolve this problem computational models have been developed incorporating related brain regions and investigating relationships with relevant behaviors or symptoms with increased robustness. Yet, few models predict each subjects’ primary symptoms of ADHD which takes individuality into account.
Methods: Using resting state brain scans of 299 children with and without ADHD, we constructed a model by using CPM(Connectome based Predictive Modeling) to predict individual differences in inattentive and hyperactive symptom severity. In addition, we generalized each of these two models to other neuropsychological test batteries to identify shared components. 
Results: Using leave-one-subject-out CPM, both inattentive and hyperactive models showed significant predictive power with generalization to novel individuals. We found predictive functional networks of inattentive and hyperactive phenotype that appear in widespread patterns across the whole-brain. Among 4 sets of  neuropsychological tests, both inattentive and hyperactive model generalized to ATA-vision and Stroop tests. This indicates that primary symptoms of ADHD that are reflected in selected functional brain features involve cognitive measurements of these two neuropsychological tests. 
Conclusions: Functional connections of an individual contain information about two primary symptoms or phenotypes of ADHD and share components with cognitive measures from certain types of neuropsychological test batteries which are ATA-vision and Stroop test.",Jee Won Yoon,,Seoul National University (grid.31501.36),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-29 12:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 12:30:00+00:00,
recin0iAsPnjcIwPL,Studying the role of the large neutral-amino acid transporter Slc7a5 in autism spectrum disorder and microcephaly,"The solute carrier transporter 7a5 (SLC7A5), a large neutral amino acid transporter, has a crucial role in maintaining branched chain amino acid (BCAA) levels in the brain. We have identified several patients harboring a homozygous missense mutation in the SLC7A5 gene, who are on the autism spectrum (ASD) and present with motor deficits and microcephaly. In mice, a deletion of Slc7a5 from the blood brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells causes decreased levels of BCAAs in the brain, altered cap-dependent translation and severe behavioral abnormalities including sociability and gait defects. 
Now, aiming to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the microcephalic phenotype of the patients, we have generated a conditional knock-out mouse line (cKO) of Slc7a5 specifically targeting neuroprogenitor cells of the developing cortex and hippocampus. 
These cKO mice present with a microcephalic brain, thereby recapitulating the patient’s phenotype. We have found that the severe reduction of cortical thickness is caused by increased apoptotic activity within the postnatal cortex. Interestingly, these elevated rates of cell death co-occur with an endogenous wave of neuronal apoptosis within a specific developmental time window. This apoptotic program has been shown to be regulated by the activity levels of cortical pyramidal neurons and is crucial for postnatal network refinement. We now aim to elucidate potential contributions of Slc7a5 to this critical process, thereby focusing on a cell type-specific role of the transporter during this neurodevelopmental time window.

We acquired respiration and resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from human participants to investigate if, where, and how respiration cyclically modulates oscillatory amplitudes (2 - 150 Hz). Using measures of phase-amplitude coupling, we show respiration-modulated brain oscillations (RMBOs) across all major frequency bands. Sources of these modulations spanned a widespread network of cortical and subcortical brain areas which formed clusters with distinct spectro-temporal modulation profiles. Globally, gamma modulation increased with distance to the head centre, whereas delta and theta modulation decreased with height in the sagittal plane. Overall, we provide the first comprehensive mapping of RMBOs across the entire brain, highlighting respiration-brain coupling as a fundamental mechanism to shape neural processing within canonical resting-state and respiratory control networks.",Daniel Kluger (he/him),"Joachim Gross, University of Münster",University of Münster (grid.5949.1),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-27 08:00:00+00:00,2020-10-27 08:15:00+00:00,
reciu46yLEWtH3kjU,Functional and Transcriptomic Diversity of Interneurons in the Hippocampal CA3 Region Probed by Patch-Seq,"Most mammalian brain regions contain diverse sets of GABAergic interneurons. These are essential in orchestrating the activity of principal neurons. Interneurons can be subclassified based on anatomical, physiological, and molecular features. In recent years, the advent of single-cell RNA-Seq has vastly expanded our knowledge of interneuron diversity regarding their transcriptional signatures. However, connecting transcriptomics with functional properties has remained challenging. The patch-seq technique quantifies electrical and transcriptomic features of the same single cell. While it lacks the high throughput of single-cell RNA-Seq, it permits direct correlation of molecular and functional properties.
We have used patch-seq in hippocampal CA3, a brain region involved in learning and memory, where GABAergic neurons are centrally involved in generating behaviorally relevant oscillations. We first measured the electrophysiological firing properties of CA3 interneurons and have subsequently sequenced the transcriptome from the same interneuron. We show that this approach can lead to the identification of novel interneuron types. We also discuss how this approach can be used to build more biologically realistic computational models of CA3. Ultimately this data could be used to model biologically plausible interneuron diversity and its functional roles.",Daniel Müller-Komorowska (he/him),"Erick Martinez Chavez, Institute of Reconstructive Neurobiology, University of Bonn School of Medicine & University Hospital Bonn, Germany; Sandra Blaess, Institute of Reconstructive Neurobiology, University of Bonn School of Medicine & University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany; Heinz Beck, Institute for Experimental Epileptology and Cognition Research, University of Bonn, Germany","Institute for Experimental Epileptology and Cognition Research, University of Bonn, Germany","Theme B: Neural Excitability, Synapses, and Glia",Traditional talk,2020-10-27 13:15:00+00:00,2020-10-27 13:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/KYoFrs_yhpI
recjBOHnK5AyeX7x6,The spatial extent of the tilt aftereffect,"The tilt aftereffect (TAE) is observed when the perceived tilt of oriented contour changes due to adaptation to another orientated contour.  So far, the TAE has generally assumed as a local aftereffect observed only at the adapted location. Here, we challenged this main assumption and investigated how the TAE spreads across different spatial locations. 
Using a peripheral adapter, we measured the TAE magnitude at 15 peripheral locations while participants were fixating on a central fixation point. Adapter grating was always presented at the same spatial location with 10.5° eccentricity to the central fixation point. In contrast, test gratings were presented randomly at 15 test locations within the same visual hemifield, including the adapter location, and two 1-up-1-down staircases determined their orientations. Participants indicated the test gratings' perceived tilt by pressing the right or left arrow key on a keyboard. The control condition was identical to the experimental condition except for adaptation. The subjective verticality (SV) of the test grating was determined by fitting a logistic regression function to the data. The TAE magnitude was calculated by subtracting the control condition's SV from the experimental condition's SV.
We found that the TAE is a non-local aftereffect that spreads across the whole visual hemifield  (N=19, p<0.05) except one location (down-row, 2.5° eccentricity, p=0.472).  To explain the computational mechanisms underlying this spread, we simulated a population of orientation-tuned neurons with different receptive fields (RFs). Based on the gain-reduction model of adaptation, we hypothesized that adaptation would decrease tuning-curves' and RFs’ sensitivity and trained our model with human data to explore how this reduction happens. Our trained-model could predict human data with 70% accuracy and provide supporting evidence for the gain-reduction model.

recjJGzi5YkONfLvM,"Functional connectivity measured during movie watching, but not rest, predicts social function in children and adolescents ","Whole-brain functional connectivity has become an increasingly popular method for relating individual differences in behavior to brain function. Functional connectivity-based models predict a variety of abilities and behaviors, including sustained attention function (Rosenberg et al., 2016) and personality dimensions (Hsu et al., 2018). Traditionally, functional connectivity research has utilized resting-state scans, thought to provide a relatively “neutral” context. However, recent work suggests that rest may not be an ideal state for studying individual differences (Finn et al., 2017). In fact, models built on functional connectivity data observed during movie-watching outperform those built on rest data in predicting cognitive and emotional phenotypes in adults (Finn et al., 2020). Here, we test whether this finding generalizes to a developmental population. Our sample consisted of 266 individuals ages 6-17, from the Healthy Brain Network Biobank (Alexander et al., 2017). We calculated individual-level functional connectomes from four fMRI scans: two resting-state scans and two scans obtained while participants watched emotionally evocative video clips. To define a summary measure of social function, we applied principal component (PC) analysis to scores on questionnaires related to social behavior (e.g., Social Responsiveness Scale) using data from Healthy Brain Network participants without usable fMRI data. Scores on the first PC, which explained 78% of the variance in the behavior-only sample, were generated for each participant in the fMRI sample. Connectome-based predictive models (Shen et al., 2017) trained and tested with 10-fold cross-validation predicted social PC scores from movie-watching, but not resting-state, data. This pattern of results was robust to effects of age, head motion, and scan duration, such that models based on movie—but not rest—data predicted social PC scores from less than three minutes of data. Thus, fMRI functional connectivity data collected during naturalistic movie viewing, rather than during rest, may best predict social function in development.",Taylor Chamberlain,"Taylor A.

recjXDnR0LlMWj6Eo,A Sparse Multiscale Nonlinear Autoregressive Model for Seizure Prediction,"Objectives: Accurate seizure prediction is highly desirable for medical interventions such as responsive electrical stimulation.  We aim to develop a classification model that can predict seizures by identifying preictal states, i.e., the precursor of a seizure, based on multi-channel intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals.
Approach: A two-level sparse multiscale classification model is developed to classify interictal and preictal states from iEEG data.  In the first level, short time-scale linear dynamical features are extracted as autoregressive (AR) model coefficients; Long time-scale linear and nonlinear dynamical features are extracted as Laguerre-Volterra autoregressive (LVAR) model coefficients; Root-mean-square error (RMSE) of model prediction is used as a feature representing model unpredictability.  In the second level, all features are fed into a sparse classifier to discriminate the iEEG data between interictal and preictal states.
Main results: The two-level model can accurately classify seizure states using iEEG data recorded from ten canine and human subjects.  Adding long time-scale and nonlinear features significantly improves model performance compared with the conventional AR modeling approach.  There is a high degree of variability in the types of features contributing to seizure prediction across different subjects.  
Significance: This study suggests that seizure generation may involve distinct linear/nonlinear dynamical processes caused by different underlying neurobiological mechanisms.  It is necessary to build patient-specific classification models with a wide range of dynamical features.

We recorded the responses of HD cells in the Anterior Thalamus, Cingulum fiber bundle and Retrosplenial Cortex of mice across the entire range of 3D head orientations. The 3D responses of HD cells can be decomposed into a 1D azimuth component that encodes head orientation in the horizontal plane, and a 2D pitch/roll component that encodes head orientation relative to vertical. The azimuth component is visually anchored, whereas the vertical component is anchored to gravity. Individual cells may encode azimuth, gravity or both; and the probability of encoding azimuth (~50%) and gravity (~66%) are independent. Furthermore, in those cells that encode both, the responses azimuth and gravity superimpose multiplicatively.

recjikGCwDj1OzFAa,Optical Stimulation and Recording Acquisition Software,"Electrophysiological recordings have traditionally been used in neuroscience to document the activities of neurons.  In the last decade, optical imaging techniques have emerged as a viable alternative for examining dynamics of populations of neurons. The most recent development is a construct that permits not only recording at very high spatial, voltage, and temporal resolution but also stimulation of individual neurons completely with optical means. Thus, it is possible to record intracellular events completely non-invasively. 
This technique however requires several pieces of equipment, which includes a high frame rate camera, an infrared laser, a digital light processor, movable microscope stages, and data storage devices. To precisely coordinate these hardware, we developed a software that runs on a Python platform using a  modular MVC (Model-View-Controller) approach and based on the PyQT framework.

recjmCzfv1IVJFQVQ,Super-resolution microscopy to investigate receptor-ribosome coupling as a mechanism to regulate local translation,"Cell surface receptors regulate a variety of essential cellular processes, including mRNA translation, to enable the response to extracellular cues required for cellular survival. In addition to the long-known signalling pathways based on post-translational modifications of downstream targets and subsequent transcriptional activation, a different mechanism linking extracellular stimuli and translation has recently been discovered in neurons. This involves the release of ribosomes tethered to cell surface receptors upon axonal guidance cue stimulation, enabling local protein synthesis (LPS). This phenomenon allows rapid and local remodelling of the axonal proteome distant from the cell body, which is essential for axonal survival and neuronal circuit formation. 
We use super-resolution microscopy to further investigate the mechanism of guidance cue-induced uncoupling of ribosomes from the guidance cue receptor deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) during axonal development. Expansion microscopy and proximity-based methods are applied to the model system Xenopus laevis retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to perform colocalization studies of receptors and different components of the translation machinery such as ribosomal proteins (RPs) and ribosome binding proteins (RBPs). Our results show a significant reduction of colocalizing ribosomes with DCC upon stimulation with the guidance cue Netrin-1, the ligand for DCC. Additionally, colocalization studies of different guidance cue receptors and RBPs confirmed a specific association of DCC with hnRNPa2b1. Together, these findings support a model of receptor specific association of ribosomes and RBPs, which enables selective mRNA translation.

recjpEPAw0OIkJs6r,Human cortical ripples reflect a spectrum of synchronous spiking activity across spatial scale,"Engagement of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and neocortex in episodic memory is strongly associated with increases in high frequency activity (HFA). Recent evidence suggests that discrete HF oscillations termed ripples are linked to memory processes. While increases in HFA during successful memory retrieval has been widely observed, the dynamic changes within individual trials are less clear. We hypothesized that resolving increases in HFA in time can reveal discrete ripple events that reflect a spectrum of dynamic spiking activity coupled to low frequency (LF) oscillations. Twenty-one participants completed a paired-associates verbal memory task in which they studied word pairs and were later cued with a word from each pair while we recorded intracranial EEG (iEEG). Six of these participants had simultaneous microelectrode array recording of single-unit spiking activity. We extracted spectral power from the iEEG signal using Morlet wavelets between 1-200 Hz. We defined discrete HFA events as ripples when 80-120 Hz spectral power exceeded two SDs for a minimum of 25 ms. Ripples were detected from simultaneous macroscale iEEG and microscale local field potential (LFP) recordings. Synchrony of discrete events were measured using pairwise phase consistency (PPC). Increases in HFA during successful memory retrieval were correlated with ripples within trials (p<0.0001). Amplitude of iEEG ripples was correlated with amplitude, number, and synchrony of LFP ripples across MEA electrodes (p<0.05). Furthermore, amplitude of LFP ripples was correlated with spiking activity and number of spiking units (p<0.05). Spike-LFP PPC was significant between 4-8 Hz and 80-120 Hz during ripples in correct memory retrieval. LFP ripple-iEEG PPC was also significant between 4-8 Hz, suggesting that spiking activity during ripple events are coordinated by theta at the microscale and macroscale (p<0.001). Overall, our data suggest that successful memory retrieval exhibits discrete ripples across spatial scale that reflect a spectrum of synchronous spiking activity. ",Ai Phuong Tong,"Ai Phuong S.

However, transferring structural knowledge to novel environments requires flexible representations that are generalizable over particularities of the current environment, such as its stimuli and size. We suggest that humans represent structural forms as abstract basis sets and that in novel tasks, the structural form is inferred and the relevant basis set is transferred. Using a computational model, we show that such representation allows inference of the underlying structural form, important task states, effective behavioural policies and the existence of unobserved state-trajectories. In two experiments, participants learned three abstract graphs during two successive days. We tested how structural knowledge acquired on Day-1 affected Day-2 performance.

recjuDnVDxSTO4gjn,Neural network models of object recognition can also account for visual search behavior,"What limits our ability to find an object we are looking for? There are two competing families of models: one explains attentional limitations during visual search in terms of a serial processing computation, the other attributes them to noisy parallel processing. These models predict search behavior for the simplified stimuli often used in experiments, but it remains unclear how to extend them to account for search of complex natural scenes. Models exist for search of natural scenes, but they do not predict whether a given scene will limit search accuracy. Here we test an alternate hypothesis that could explain limitations across stimuli types: visual search is limited by an ""untangling"" computation, proposed to underlie object recognition. To test this hypothesis, we ask whether models of object recognition account for visual search behavior. The current best-in-class models are artificial neural networks (ANNs) that accurately predict both behavior and neural activity in the visual system during object recognition tasks. Unlike dominant search models, ANNs can provide predictions for any image. First we test ANN-based object recognition models with simplified stimuli typically used in studies of visual search. We find these models exhibit a hallmark effect of such studies: a drop in target detection accuracy as the number of distractors increases. Further experiments show this effect results from learned representations: networks that are not pre-trained for object recognition can achieve near perfect accuracy. Next we test these models with complex natural images, using a version of the Pascal VOC dataset where each image has a visual search difficulty score, derived from human reaction times. We find models exhibit a drop in accuracy as search difficulty score increases. We conclude that ANN-based object recognition models account for aspects of visual search behavior across stimuli types, and discuss how to extend these results.",David Nicholson (he/him/they),"Astrid Prinz, Emory University",Emory University (grid.189967.8),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-27 16:15:00+00:00,2020-10-27 16:30:00+00:00,
recjxgcL9W0ne4j11,Learning compositional sequences with multiple time scales through a hierarchical network of spiking neurons,"Sequential behaviour is often compositional and organised across multiple time scales: a set of individual elements developing on short time scales (motifs) are combined to form longer functional sequences (syntax). Such organisation leads to a natural hierarchy that can be used advantageously for learning, since the motifs and the syntax can be acquired independently. Despite mounting experimental evidence for hierarchical structures in neuroscience, models for temporal learning based on neuronal networks have mostly focused on serial methods. Here, we introduce a network model of spiking neurons with a hierarchical organisation aimed at sequence learning on multiple time scales. Using biophysically motivated neuron dynamics and local plasticity rules, the model can learn motifs and syntax independently. Furthermore, the model can relearn sequences efficiently and store multiple sequences. Compared to serial learning, the hierarchical model displays faster learning, more flexible relearning, increased capacity, and higher robustness to perturbations. The hierarchical model redistributes the variability: it achieves high motif fidelity at the cost of higher variability in the between-motif timings.

Studies have shown that i.p injection of lipopoysaccharide (LPS) induces depressive-like behavior in rodents via induction of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Methyl jasmonate (MJ), an isolated compound from jasmine plant has gained reputation in aromatherapy for treatment of depression, nervousness and memory deficits. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of MJ on LPS-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. Mice were given MJ (5-20 mg/kg), imipramine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (10 mL/kg) intraperitoneally for 7 consecutive days. On day 7, treatment was carried out 30 min prior to i.p injection of LPS (0.8 mg/kg). Twenty four hours after LPS administration, tail suspension, forced swim and sucrose preference tests were carried out. Thereafter, serum corticosterone levels were determined using ELISA. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and TNF alpha were determined in brain tissue homogenates. LPS significantly increased immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swim tests when compared with vehicle (p < 0.05), which indicates depressive-like syndromes. However, the increased immobility time was significantly reduced by MJ (5-20 mg/kg) when compared with LPS-treated group. LPS administration also altered the levels of MDA, GSH, corticosterone and TNF alpha in mice, which was significantly reversed by MJ. These findings suggest that attenuation of LPS-induced depressive-like behavior by MJ may be related to suppression of oxidative stress and release of TNF alpha.

Moreover, similarities to the functional architecture of the brain make lipids a potential target for the diagnosis of mental disorders.

In our present study, we were, for the first time, able to successfully isolate single units in the vestibular nuclei using chronically-implanted Neuropixel IMEC 3B probes with 960 recording sites in head-restrained mice. The probe was positioned in the brain, such that there were approximately 112 recording sites in the medial vestibular nuclei. Spike sorting algorithms, namely, Kilosort2 and JRClust, were used for isolating the units. In total, we were able to isolate up to ten head movement-sensitive neurons by passively moving the head using the vestibular ocular reflex paradigm. The units showed robust head velocity sensitivity and no sensitivity for eye position and eye velocity during the static eye position and optokinetic reflex evoking paradigms, as inferred from their firing rates. The head velocity sensitivity (0.25 ± 0.12 (sp/s) / (deg/s)) and the baseline firing rate (18.56 ± 9.03 sp/s) of the neurons agreed with those reported by Beraneck and Cullen (2007) using tungsten microelectrodes. Moreover, our analysis of isolated units provided consistent results across both the above-mentioned spike sorting software. Overall, our results highlight the neuropixel probe’s success to investigate deep brain regions and simultaneously record many single units, thereby extending our ability to probe these circuits beyond the capabilities of the conventional tungsten and glass microelectrodes. The future direction of the study is to use the neuropixel probes for recording from head-free mice to understand the neuronal encoding of active movement in the vestibular nuclei.

recjzGwpJtJHN3vLT,A series of genetically encoded GRAB sensors for measuring serotonin dynamics in vivo ,"Serotonin (also called 5-HT) is an important monoamine neuromodulator, critical for regulation of sleep, appetite control as well as learning and memory. Malfunction of 5-HT system also involved in depression, addiction, compulsivity and other neurological disorders. One major obstacle to understand the physiological regulation of 5-HT is lack of sensitive methods to decipher the dynamics of 5-HT non-invasively with good cell specificity and high spatiotemporal  resolution, especially in vivo. Here, we developed a series of genetically-encoded 5-HT sensors by coupling cpEGFP or cpmApple with 5-HT receptors. Upon 5-HT binding, the chimeric receptor changes its conformation which leads to a subsequent fluorescent signal increase from the embedded cpEGFP or cpmApple , therefore reporting 5-HT. We named this kind of sensors “the GPCR Activation Based sensors for 5-HT, short for GRAB5-HT. With iterative engineering, we developed a series of GRAB5-HT sensors with high specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrated GRAB5-HT sensors could be applied in multiple organisms, including Drosophila, mice and monkey for reliable detection of 5-HT in vivo. Thus, this tool would enhance our understanding of complex neuromodulation both in health and in diseases.

reckC4YTNvUvHl4nA,A Multiscale Cortico-Basal Ganglia Model for Arm Reaching Task in Normal and Parkinsonian Conditions,"A major underlying cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the idiopathic loss of dopaminergic neurons in Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc). Dopamine deficiency due to the loss of SNc neurons manifests in cardinal symptoms of PD, including tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural imbalance. To investigate the PD condition in detail and manage its symptoms, it is important to have an integrated multiscale computational model that can replicate the symptoms at the behavioral level by evoking some of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the pathology. In line with this, we developed a multiscale integrated model of cortico-basal ganglia motor circuitry for arm reaching task incorporating a detailed biophysical model of SNc dopaminergic neuron. Computational models of the basal ganglia tend to take a dichotomous approach, describing exclusively at a detailed biophysical level or at abstract information processing level using concepts from Reinforcement Learning (RL), without working out the relationship between the two levels.  In our model, we replace the abstract representations of reward with the realistic variable of extracellular dopamine released by a network of SNc cells and incorporate it with the RL-based behavioral model, which simulates the reaching task. Our results showed that as SNc cell loss increases, the success rate in reaching the target decreased, while the average reaching time increased. In addition, the biophysical model of SNc allows us to explore an important hypothesis related to the cause of PD - the link between cellular energy deficiency and the death of dopaminergic cells. The RL-based behavioral component of the model gives us the flexibility to simulate the various PD symptoms e.g. tremor and bradykinesia. We conclude that our model presents a realistic and efficient way of simulating arm reaching task in normal and Parkinsonian conditions, thereby allowing us to understand how neurochemical dysfunction leads to behavioral abnormalities.",Sandeep Sathyanandan Nair,"Sandeep Sathyanandan Nair, Indian Institute of Technology Madras; Vignayanandam R.

reckCl77fUilwliP6,Reward-biased transitive inference task in rhesus macaques.,"If we know that person A is taller than person B, and B is taller than C, we can infer that A is taller than C. Such deduction is called a transitive inference (TI) and refers to the learning of novel relationships between pairs or groups of items that are implied by pairwise comparisons, whether they be verbal or non-verbal.
Numerous animal studies have revealed that all vertebrates tested to date display the ability to make transitive inferences. This ability is thought to be fundamental to understanding ordered sets such as social hierarchies.  Consensus has not yet been reached whether TI task performance depends on model-free or model-based learning mechanisms, or a combination of both.  
In traditional TI paradigms, subjects are presented a single list of ~7 items per session. Here, to test the mechanism behind TI task, we trained monkeys using two ordered lists of five items (images A to E) with reward disparity. Each training trial presented a pair of items and the earlier item (e.g. B from BC) was always the correct response. However, correct responses to List 1 were associated with 2 units of rewards, while List 2 was associated with 5 units of rewards. Once monkeys had learned both training lists (e.g. B1C1), they were tested with between-list adjacent (B1C2) and non-adjacent (B1D2) pairs. On the one hand, we found a powerful bias for items from List 2, consistent with a preference for items that had been paired with larger rewards during training. On the other hand, however, we also found that rewards did not entirely determine preference, with monkeys able to respond above chance overall, once the reward bias had been accounted for. This suggests that both model-based and model-free learning contribute to performance on TI tasks.

Mechanisms for describing concepts related to neuroscience research are growing in breadth and depth, number and popularity. In parallel, more and more neuroscience-related data — and particularly metadata — are being made available under open licenses, which facilitates discoverability, reproducibility and reuse, as well as data integration.

Wikidata is a community-curated open knowledge base in which concepts covered in any Wikipedia — and beyond — can be described in a structured and FAIR fashion that can be mapped to RDF and queried using SPARQL as well as various other means. Its community of over 20,000 monthly contributors oversees a corpus of currently over 90 million 'items’ for concepts that are linked amongst each other, to external databases or to specific values via over 7000 'properties'. Items and properties have persistent unique identifiers, to which labels, descriptions and dedicated lexemes and their forms and senses can be attached in over 300 natural languages.

reckd0gg8yrMpkAQS,Alteration of perineuronal net expression in the primary somatosensory cortex during maternal behavior,"Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in MECP2, a gene expression regulator. RTT is hypothesized to be a sensory processing disorder, which could contribute to the higher-order cognition and social communication phenotypes. How MECP2 deficiency causes sensory processing issues is currently unknown. We use a female mouse model of RTT (Het) to study how MECP2 regulates the timing of experience-dependent plasticity during complex multisensory behaviors, such as the pup gathering paradigm. MECP2 is essential for regulating experience-dependent plasticity, as measured by perineuronal net (PNN) expression, in the auditory cortex during pup gathering. PNNs are extracellular matrix structures surrounding parvalbumin + GABAergic neurons in the cortex, and regulate their synaptic activity. Since efficient pup gathering behavior requires auditory, olfactory and somatosensory cues, we chose to look at PNN expression within the primary somatosensory cortex (SS1). We found that adult Hets perform the pup gathering behavior poorly and show an increase in PNN density within SS1 before (Naïve) and after (Sur) behavioral experience. This suggests that adult NaiveHets are unable to process tactile information causing their poor behavioral performance. By time course analysis, we found that adolescent Naïve Hets had similar PNN density to Naïve WT. Interestingly, adolescent SurHets still performed poorly in the pup gathering paradigm. Through whole brain immunohistochemical analysis of the SS1 in adolescent SurHets, we found 1) PNN density is increased in the SS1of SurHet in specific subregions and 2) the pattern of PNN density alterations in the adolescent and adult SS1 SurHet is different. This shows that, regardless of age, MECP2 is needed in SS1 to regulate the timing of PNN formation, during a complex sensory behavior. Overall, experience-dependent plasticity in the auditory and primary somatosensory cortex is dysregulated in the MECP2-Het mutant resulting in poor execution of a social communication paradigm.","Dana Layo (she, her, hers)","Dana E.

reckdmLlU9qr9umDD,Non-stimulated regions in early visual cortex encode the contents of conscious visual perception,"Predictions shape our perception. The theory of predictive processing poses that our brains make sense of incoming sensory input by generating predictions, which are sent back from higher to lower levels of the processing hierarchy. These predictions are based on our internal model of the world and enable inferences about the hidden causes of the sensory input data. It has been proposed that conscious perception corresponds to the currently most probable internal model of the world. Accordingly, predictions influencing conscious perception should be fed back from higher to lower levels of the processing hierarchy. An elegant way to isolate effects of feedback signalling in the human brain is to measure neural activity in regions of retinotopic visual cortex that do not receive feedforward input. For example, previous fMRI studies have shown that non-stimulated parts of early visual cortex contain content-specific information from the surrounding visual context, most likely mediated by feedback signalling. Here, we asked whether the actual contents of conscious visual perception would also be reflected by neural signals in non-stimulated regions of early visual cortex. In our fMRI experiment, participants viewed large-field ambiguous visual motion stimuli that spared a subregion of the visual field. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis of fMRI signals, we could decode the participants’ reported perception not only from stimulated regions of early visual cortex, but also from non-stimulated subregions. These results indicate that early sensory cortices in the human brain receive predictive feedback signals that reflect the current contents of conscious perception.

This gap poses a significant barrier for the study of learning mechanisms. Here we show that a calcium-based plasticity rule regulating layer 5 PC synapses holds also for several other pyramidal-to-pyramidal connections in a digital model of the somatosensory cortex. In particular, we show that differences in postsynaptic calcium dynamics are sufficient to explain the in vitro results on PC connections plasticity.

","With growing concern of a forthcoming reproducibility crisis in how MRI data is analyzed, it is paramount that a gold-standard of statistical practice is realized so that accurate comparisons can be made between studies investigating brain topology and function. Machine-learning models offer an easily accessible solution to generating reproducible and scalable data in the segmentation and statistical analysis of the brain’s complex neural structure. 

“Connectomics” refers to the investigation of how brain networks communicate within and between one other, with the end goal of ascribing function and identifying irregularities in the wiring of healthy and pathological brain states, respectively. 

To combat the challenges presented with the time taken and standardization steps required when processing large-scale data sets, we have developed a new multimodal image processing pipeline: o8t Labs. Labs utilizes machine-learning and cloud computing to offer a standardized and streamlined approach to performing structural and functional connectomic analyses. 

Requiring an anatomical T1, resting-state fMRI and DTI image series, Labs first performs constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) to generate a structural connectivity of the brains white matter tracts. Through the application of machine learning models, we are then able to re-parcellate regions derived from the HCP Atlas onto realigned resting-state image series, creating an individualized brain atlas for further analyses. Functional connectomic analysis is then performed, correlating BOLD signal change at rest between each parcellation of the loaded subject’s brain. These correlations are compared against a bank of 250 healthy controls to determine typical and atypical functional connectivity.  

Multiple exports are currently available in Labs including processed image series, a structural atlas (delivered in NIFTI), as well as structural and functional connectivity matrices. The intention of these exports is for simplified re-integration into other analytic workflows.

Here, we consider how long-range inputs from lateral habenula (LHb) influence circuit dynamics in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) using electrophysiological, computational and behavioral strategies. We find that habenulo-raphe afferents triggered classical monosynaptic excitation of 5-HT neurons, as well as strong disynaptic inhibition whose induction was steeply frequency-dependent and which persisted for seconds. This novel inhibition was mediated by a GIRK conductance activated by 5-HT1A receptors. To determine the network motifs underlying this protracted inhibition, we undertook optogenetic and pharmacological manipulations in DRN. These experiments revealed, unexpectedly, that 5-HT neurons are organized in a recurrent inhibitory network, refuting the classical model of autocrine activation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Electrical stimulation approaches revealed that these inhibitory connections exhibited robust, dramatic short-term facilitation that we formalized with a linear-nonlinear plasticity model. To examine how this nonlinearity affects input-output transformation, we constructed an experimentally-constrained network model of DRN which incorporated the experimentally-fitted plasticity model at inhibitory connections. We find that excitatory inputs led to paradoxical inhibition of DRN at high frequencies, and that this polarity switch was dependent on plasticity dynamics and not on recurrent inhibition itself. To test the physiological relevance of this computation for processing threat information from the LHb, we developed a simple auditory classical conditioning paradigm and tested key predictions of our model through in vivo optogenetics. We uncovered a nonlinear transformation where stimulating the habenulo-raphe pathway at high-frequency, but not at low frequency, depressed goal-directed anticipatory licking behavior.

Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE-HE) commonly report mnemonic deficits that have been associated with failures in PS. However, the link between these impairments and the integrity of the hippocampal subfields in these patients has not yet been determined.

To reach this goal we evaluated the memory of the patients with an improved object mnemonic similarity test. We then analyzed the hippocampal complex integrity with structural and microstructural diffusion data from high resolution 3T MRI. Our data indicate that patients with unilateral mTLE-HE present more difficulties in the mnemonic discrimination test that target PS, especially in conditions with higher interference.

reckktnIhGFLCL1SG,Synaptic Scaling of Excitatory Post Synaptic firings in Hippocampal Neurons. ,"Synaptic plasticity provides the basis for modeling of learning, memory, and development in neural circuits. Information is stored in neural circuits through long-standing changes in synaptic strengths. Most studies of information storage have focused on mechanisms such as long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), in which synaptic strength changes in a synapse-specific manner. In contrast, little attention has been paid to molecular mechanisms that regulate the local synaptic signaling, postsynaptic firing, or large-scale changes in network activity which are required to induce synaptic scaling. In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons persistent potentiation, and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated spiking of postsynaptic neurons. Chronic blockade of hippocampal culture activity increased the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) without changing their kinetics. Conversely, blocking GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) mediated inhibition initially raised firing rates, but over 48 hours ESPC amplitudes decreased and firing rates returned to close to control values. These changes were partly due to postsynaptic alterations in the response to glutamate and affected each synapse in proportion to its initial strength. Here, we selectively block postsynaptic firing in individual neurons while optically monitoring changes in synaptic strength. Such synaptic scaling may help to ensure that it is rapidly induced by a block of postsynaptic firing, but not by the local synaptic blockade. Hippocampal neurons thus homeostatically adjust synaptic strengths in response to changes in their own firing rate, a mechanism with the computational advantage of efficiently normalizing synaptic strengths without interfering with synapse-specific mechanisms of information storage.

reckn93rD8g3p8aSO,The interhemispheric interactions in cortical plasticity,"The two hemispheres of the brain are commonly treated as independent structures when peripheral or cortical manipulations are applied to one of them. The contralateral hemisphere is often used as a within-animal control of plastic changes induced onto the other side of the brain. This ensures uniform conditions for producing experimental and control data, but it may overlook possible interhemispheric interactions. We provide, for the first time, direct proof that cortical, experience-dependent plasticity is not a unilateral, independent process.
We mapped metabolic brain activity in rats with 2-[14C] deoxyglucose (2DG) following experience-dependent plasticity induction after a month of unilateral (left), partial whiskers deprivation (only row B was left). This resulted in  ~45% widening of the cortical sensory representation of the spared whiskers in the right, contralateral barrel field (BF). We show that the width of 2DG visualized representation is less than 20% when only contralateral stimulation of the spared row of whiskers is applied in immobilized animals. This means that cortical map remodeling, which is induced by experience-dependent plasticity mechanisms, depends partially on the contralateral hemisphere. The response, which is observed by 2DG brain mapping in the partially deprived BF after standard synchronous bilateral whiskers stimulation, is therefore the outcome of at least two separately activated plasticity mechanisms (center cerround in 2DG visualised representation). A focus on the integrated nature of cortical plasticity, which is the outcome of the emergent interactions between deprived and non-deprived areas in both hemispheres may have important implications for learning and rehabilitation.

recktPyntYEaLoQjO,"New ways to analyze and visualize large-scale network activity in sea slugs with single-neuron, single-spike resolution","Despite an ever-growing body of research elucidating how neural networks produce behavior, the contributions of specific neurons within those networks are often poorly understood. In particular, achieving both the temporal and spatial resolution in activity recordings of neuronal populations required to develop detailed bottom-up insights about how behavior is generated has proven to be a challenge for network neuroscience. Simple nervous systems, like those of gastropod mollusks, comprise relatively few, large, mostly superficial and individually identifiable neurons. This enables both electrophysiological and optical recordings with single-neuron, single-spike specificity over significant portions of those nervous systems, allowing for more thorough neuroethological investigation. Here, we discuss several computational tools we have recently developed to visualize and animate optical data collected in the brains of gastropod mollusks as a part of a BRAIN Initiative project taking a multi-dimensional approach to understanding how networks produce behavior. Large-scale optical recordings are obtained of motor programs of interest, using a photodiode array imaging at 1,600 samples/s and a fast-absorbance voltage-sensitive dye. These signals are then blind source separated into individual neuronal activity traces using independent component analysis. A custom algorithm maps the individual neuronal signals onto their source neurons in the recorded brain region, and then animates these maps to generate audiovisual “playbacks” of network activity with high spatiotemporal resolution. Through the use of a previously developed unsupervised community detection algorithm, we can also derive the functional neuronal ensembles operating during behavioral programs. Together, these tools constitute an ultra-fast workflow that provides same-day insights about both single-cell activity and network organization in recorded brain regions. This approach is well-suited to exploring network function in little studied, nontransgenic species, such as we are currently doing with the nudibranch Berghia stephanieae.",Viral Mistry,"Jeffrey Brown, RFUMS; Evan Hill, RFUMS; William Frost, RFUMS",Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science (grid.262641.5),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-29 18:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 18:30:00+00:00,
reckvovN4aFHosRjC,Exploring the Role of the Endoplasmic Reticulum in Regulating Activity-Driven Intracellular Calcium Signaling in Drosophila Elementary Motion Detection,"Intracellular Ca2+ regulates several processes, including synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major neuronal Ca2+ reservoir. Although much is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying ER Ca2+ uptake and release, it is unclear how these dynamics contribute to neuronal activity in vivo. In this work, we investigated the role of the ER in intracellular Ca2+ signaling in Drosophila local motion detection. Cell-types within this circuit exhibit cytosolic Ca2+ response kinetics spanning various timescales. This cell-type-specific temporal filtering is critical for motion detection, but the cellular mechanisms underlying temporal filtering are unknown. Since ER Ca2+ handling can regulate cytosolic Ca2+, we hypothesized that the ER tunes cell-type-specific temporal filtering properties in motion detection. To test this, we measured stimulus-evoked ER and cytosolic Ca2+ signals in neurons in flies using two-photon microscopy. We found, first, that visual stimuli drive different ER Ca2+ signals depending on the cell-type and compartment. For example, within Mi1 neurons, dendrites exhibit slow, sustained (~1s) ER Ca2+ release, and axon terminals exhibit rapid, sustained (~100ms-1s) Ca2+ uptake. Thus, the ER acts as a Ca2+ source or sink during activation over different timescales. Second, we found that RNAi knockdown of ER Ca2+ efflux channel inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) perturbs ER and cytosolic Ca2+ signaling. IP3R knockdown reduces ER Ca2+ uptake in Mi1 axons and Ca2+ release in dendrites, suggesting that homeostatic mechanisms reduce Ca2+ uptake when Ca2+ release is impaired. Finally, we found that reduced ER Ca2+ uptake in Mi1 axon terminals after IP3R knockdown is associated with more sustained cytosolic Ca2+ responses to visual stimuli, suggesting that ER Ca2+ handling regulates temporal filtering properties underlying motion detection. Altogether, we propose that the ER plays a critical role in regulating activity-driven intracellular Ca2+ signals in neurons in vivo, thereby tuning single-cell processing and circuit function.

The TgF344-AD rat model of AD exhibits similar behavioral and pathological features to humans and thus serves as an excellent model to investigate mechanisms underlying spatial impairment in AD. Previously, we found that 10-month-old TgF344-AD rats make progressively less spatially precise movements during a reference memory variant of the Morris water maze. TgF344-AD rats also exhibit progressive pathology in cortical areas involved in the coding of head direction. Thus, this study sought to characterize head direction (HD) cells in the postsubiculum, a prominent HD cell loci, in 15 - 19 month female TgF344-AD rats and aged matched F344 controls. Rats performed a pellet chasing task within a cylinder fitted with a white cue card during recordings. In some sessions, the cue card was rotated to assess landmark control. HD cells from TgF344-AD rats exhibited increased peak firing rates, but maintained directional firing characteristics similar to that of controls. Additionally, responses to the cue card rotation were similar to that of controls, but with greater variability. These results will be discussed in relation to the hypothesis that head direction cell dysfunction contributes to spatial impairment in Alzheimer’s disease.",Laura Berkowitz,"Laura E.

Yet, it is unknown to what degree the development of visually guided oculomotor control depends on early visual experience—for example, whether and to what degree humans whose sight was restored after a transient period of congenital visual deprivation are able to conduct visually guided eye movements. In the present study, we developed new calibration and analysis techniques for eye tracking data contaminated with pervasive nystagmus, which is typical for this population. We investigated visually guided eye movements in sight recovery individuals with long periods of visual pattern deprivation (3–36 years) following birth due to congenital, dense, total, bilateral cataracts. As controls we assessed (1) individuals with nystagmus due to causes other than cataracts, (2) individuals with developmental cataracts after cataract removal, and (3) individuals with normal vision. Congenital cataract reversal individuals were able to perform visually guided gaze shifts, even when their blindness had lasted for decades. The typical extensive nystagmus of this group distorted eye movement trajectories, but measures of latency and accuracy were as expected from their prevailing nystagmus—that is, not worse than in the nystagmus control group. To the best of our knowledge, the present quantitative study is the first to investigate the characteristics of oculomotor control in congenital cataract reversal individuals, and it indicates a remarkable effectiveness of visually guided eye movements despite long-lasting periods of visual deprivation.",Paul Zerr,José Pablo Ossandón; Idris Shareef; Stefan Van der Stigchel; Ramesh Kekunnaya; Brigitte Röder,Utrecht University (grid.5477.1),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-28 12:15:00+00:00,2020-10-28 12:30:00+00:00,

There is growing evidence that cortical inhibitory synapses are highly plastic, including differences in cell-type-specific GABAergic inputs onto layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (Chiu et al. Neuron 2018). In the auditory cortex, we have found that an unusual left-lateralized form of short-term inhibitory depression might help enable longer-term changes to both excitation and inhibition for enhanced responses to pup calls in maternal mice (Marlin et al. Nature 2015, Schiavo et al. Nature 2020). 

Here we examined short-term and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) of different inhibitory inputs onto layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of adult mouse auditory cortex in slices. STDP is a method for inducing input-specific and long-term modifications of synaptic strength, where short-term plasticity reflects the dynamic synaptic strength based on recent history. These mechanisms might underlie the synchronization of stimulus-evoked inhibitory input during development (Dorrn et al. Nature 2010, Field et al. Neuron 2020) and after conditioning or maternal experience. 
	
We utilized isolated expression of channelrhodopsin-2 in various GABAergic interneurons to selectively activate these inputs. Somatostatin interneurons are distinct physiologically, expressing STDP (169% potentiated current, n = 11, p < 0.05) as compared to PV, VIP and Layer-1 interneurons. Somatostatin also demonstrate differential depression to repetitive stimulation (df = 3, F = 3.26, p < 0.05), depending on hemisphere, as compared to PV. Our data suggest somatostatin interneurons are critical for laterality in the auditory cortex.","Soomin Song (He, Him)","Robert C.

However, there are often substantial gaps between them in both space and time. The biological mechanism capable of spanning those gaps remains unknown. One promising, albeit hypothetical, mechanism involves neural replay of non-local experience. Using a novel task, that segregates direct from indirect learning, combined with magnetoencephalography (MEG), we probed the role of neural replay in non-local learning in humans. Following reward receipt, we found significant backward replay of non-local experience, with a 160 msec state-to-state time lag, and this replay facilitated learning of action values. This backward replay, combined with behavioural evidence of non-local learning, was more pronounced in experiences that were of greater benefit for future behavior, as predicted by theories of prioritization.

reclpr3KePwLQ2El7,Exact neural mass model for synaptic-based working memory,"A synaptic theory of Working Memory (WM) has been developed in the last decade to overcome
several drawbacks related to the persistent spiking paradigm. Memory items are maintained in
the synaptic facilitation and refreshed thanks to Population Bursts (PBs) promoted by synaptic
depression. We have developed a neural mass model based on a recent study on the macroscopic
description of spiking neuronal networks and a well established model for plastic synapses. It is
capable of reproducing exactly the dynamics of heterogeneous spiking neural networks with short-
term synaptic plasticity. This neural mass model gives access not only to the population firing rate,
but also to the mean membrane potential. The latter is correlated to the Local Field Potentials
and to electroencephalographic signals, usually measured during WM tasks to characterize the brain
dynamics. The model is able to mimic several operations required by WM : memory loading, memory
maintenance, competition of memory items and multi-item memory juggling. Memory access and
loading is associated to self-sustained oscillations in the β-γ band and to transient evoked responses
in the δ band, analogous to what is observed in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys during object
recognition tasks. More items can be stored in the WM by considering neural architectures composed
by multiple excitatory populations and a common inhibitory pool. The items can be loaded and
maintained at the same time: they are represented as trains of PBs with the same period, but
delivered at evenly shifted phases. A memory competition is observable already by loading only two
items. Depending on the stimulation features we can observe three different outcomes: maintenance
of the first or second loaded item or their juggling in the memory. As reported in many experiments,
the γ-band power increases with the number of loaded items. The power in the α-β instead shows
a non monotonic behaviour. Finally, we report an expression for the maximal capacity adapted to
the present model and architecture.

reclrx4y93VJ8A7uC,Animal-to-Animal Variability in Hippocampal Remapping,"Hippocampal place cells form a unique map for each environment, a phenomenon known as hippocampal remapping.  What qualifies as a sufficiently different environment to give rise to a new hippocampal map is unclear, and different studies provide superficially conflicting results.  In particular, many experiments have observed unexplained variability in remapping behavior between different animals.
Recent work has organized disparate phenomena associated with remapping by framing the context identification problem that the hippocampus is ostensibly solving as a hidden state inference problem. Lack of access to objective hidden state labels lead to an inherent ambiguity in identifying which experiences deserve unique maps.  Animal variability can potentially be a result of different animals having characteristically different parameter settings in resolving this ambiguity.
We reanalyze a published data set collected from rats foraging in 11 different rooms, including a variety of types of repetitions of those rooms.  We find that variability between these animals in remapping behavior is highly structured: different animals have characteristically different remapping behaviors across different types of repetitions of these rooms.  For example, remapping between repetitions of an environment when the animal is not removed from a room correlate with remapping between repetitions of an environment much later in the day.  We also find heterogeneity in remapping behavior across the place cell population within an animal. Overall, we find evidence that different animals have consistently different remapping responses to the same experiences, emphasizing the subjective nature of hippocampal remapping.

However, much less attention is been drawn to pre-stimulus preparatory processes. Previously, the brain preparation topology was shown on fMRI-data, we aimed to replicate this result and distinguish pre-stimulus reconfiguration of brain functional network on EEG-data. During EEG recording 76 participants were asked to identify the correctness of stimuli, belonging to one of three types: sentence in the native language, algebraic equations and simple addition. 2 seconds before each stimulus, the cue was shown. Functional connectivity in this interval was estimated in sensor space via the imaginary part of coherency and graph was constructed from the 25% of strongest connections. Multiclass sparse logistic regression was used as the classifier on 5 global (median path length, assortativity degree, average clustering coefficient, global and local efficiency) and 5 local measures (degree, rich-club coefficient, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality k-core index) and with Leave-one-out as the train-test split. We were not able to correctly classified pre-stimulus functional connectivity with accuracy ranging from 31% to 38% for the different frequency bands. This result might reflect several drawbacks in our analysis. First, the topological resolution of 64-channel EEG might be inadequate for the extraction of differences between stimuli. Second, issues with the graph construction, poor choice of synchronization measure or threshold of the strongest connections. Third, target differences could hide in the temporal dynamics of network reconfiguration, which is completely obscured by averaging across the whole pre-stimulus time window. We also want to point out that similar classification applied to participants shows accuracy from 61% to 90%, thus emphasizing the importance of individual differences in functional connectivity studies.

Such implants are mounted to the skull and commonly build from hard, durable materials. Especially in larger animals, which participate in experiments over extended periods of time, implants should match the skull curvature to promote osseointegration and avoid tissue and bacterial ingress over time. 

Proposed CAD methods for designing implants to date have focused on naïve animals with continuous and even skull surfaces and calculate Boolean differences between implant and skull surface to fit the implant to the skull curvature. However, custom-fitting by calculating the difference fails if a discontinuous skull surface needs to be matched. Also, the difference method does not allow designs which require constant material thickness along the curvature after fitting.

We present a universal guide for custom-fitted design of skull implants and production. Its major advancement is its suitability to unusual skull conditions, such as discontinuities or irregularities on the skull surface. It furthermore provides a description of virtual implant bending to match the skull curvature while maintaining implant thickness, e.g. for using fixed screw lengths. The guide makes use of only a few software tools and the final virtual product can be manufactured using CNC milling or 3D printing. 
We demonstrate the process for a wide spectrum of scenarios ranging from complex-shaped single-pieced implants to detailed multi-component implant systems– built on even or discontinuous skull and report the experience over several years in four rhesus monkeys.

recmHbizYvwDQusPS,Efficient coding of numbers explains decision bias and noise,"Multi-attribute decisions require the encoding of several pieces of information, followed by their aggregation. A simple example is averaging. When asked to compare averages of numbers, human subjects have been reported to differentially weight different numbers, even though these should be equally relevant to a correct decision. This selective weighting has been interpreted as resulting from a biased encoding of the numbers, that optimally compensates for the presence of internal noise arising later in the decision process (Spitzer et al., 2017). A natural alternative assumption is that numbers are encoded with noise, then optimally decoded from the noisy representations. Under the hypothesis of efficient coding, the degree of encoding noise should vary in an optimal way across the stimulus space, and should depend on the statistics of the numbers.
We investigate these predictions through a task in which subjects are asked to compare the averages of two series of numbers, each sampled from the same prior distribution, whose shape we manipulate across blocks of trials. We find that our subjects seem to encode the numbers with a bias, but also with a degree of noise that varies with the size of the number. In particular, numbers that are unlikely under the prior are encoded with greater noise. We further show that a maximum-likelihood decoding model captures subjects’ behavior, and indicates that the encoding is efficiently adapted to the prior, resulting in higher expected rewards in the task.
Furthermore, our model predicts a relation between the bias and the variability of estimates, thus providing a statistically-founded, parsimonious derivation of the “law of human perception” (Wei and Stocker, 2017). Our results both shed new experimental light on human processing of numerical information, and increase our theoretical understanding of an encoding-decoding paradigm in which efficient coding is combined with inference from noisy internal representations, resulting in biases and variability at the behavioral level.",Arthur Prat-Carrabin,"Michael Woodford, Columbia University",Columbia University (grid.21729.3f),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-30 21:30:00+00:00,2020-10-30 21:45:00+00:00,

The internal representation of such directional sense requires angular head velocity (AHV) information. However, despite numerous studies on head direction, place, and grid cells, little is known about the computations underlying AHV signalling, and in particular, how this is achieved in higher order cortical regions in the mammalian brain. Using high-density single-unit recordings, we describe the activity of AHV neurons in the retrosplenial cortex (RSP) of mice exploring a large arena, and in response to vestibular and visual motion stimuli under controlled head-fixed conditions. We find that many AHV neurons display similar tuning properties during active (freely moving) and passive motion (head-fixed rotations in yaw), and combine vestibular and visual inputs to increase the gain and signal-to-noise ratio of angular velocity coding during navigation. Further, using a novel go/no-go task and computational methods, we demonstrate that vestibular-visual combination increases the perceptual accuracy of own velocity, and the fidelity of its representation by RSP neuronal ensembles. These findings provide novel insights into cortical computations underlying representation of self-motion during navigation.

recmMRDe8aGdYvyuH,Spatial Symmetry and its Relation to Grammatical Structures,"Although there has been substantial debate over the merits of neural versus symbolic models of cognition, both approaches face a similar fundamental challenge. In each case, the set of functions available to the modeller includes every computable function, and so the fundamental question of which subset of these functions is cognitively relevant still needs to be answered, whichever toolkit is chosen. Within the symbolic approach, the Chomsky hierarchy provides an important example of possible constraints on the computational power of a formal grammar, in relation to human linguistic behaviour. In contrast, the most important constraint employed within the field of deep learning, has been the translational symmetry of image processing as implemented in convolutional networks. 

Superficially at least, these appear to be two quite divergent means of limiting the space of functions, relating to the structure of space versus the syntax of natural languages. However, it is nonetheless possible to draw a connection between them. In particular, we show that imposing a convolutional structure on the memory cells of a recurrent network produces a stack like data structure, suitable for handling Context Free Grammars, the most common formalism applied to natural languages. Such an architecture reuses the symmetry under spatial translations employed within image processing applications as a method to obtain the uniformity across memory registers that is required for the same symbol to be represented at multiple locations. 

Thus, despite their differences, neural and symbolic researchers have found their attention drawn to spaces of functions that share a common ingredient, in terms of translation invariance across a set of equivalent positions. More abstractly, we argue that symmetry has an important role to play in delimiting sets of interesting functions, that goes beyond just spatial translations and convolution.",Jeff Mitchell,"Jeffrey S.

Collective pattern generators are produced by the stretching motions produced by the actin filaments of two neighboring cells. These synchronized movements propagate down the colony in an undulating, accordion -like manner. While we can utilize a neural model to characterize the behavior of this type of multicellular colony, psychophysical models are used to characterize pseudo-neuronal behaviors. 

We will use a database of images and movies of Bacillaria movement (Alicea et.al, 2019) to capture measurements of colony movement and to train a generative model of movement dynamics. Using these data and a model, we can then establish an input/output curve that determines how much input results in a corresponding degree of output. From these input/output curves, we can derive just-noticeable differences and signal detection measurements. To model the movements that lead to statistical regularities, we propose a connectionist model in which nodes (neuronal units) can act as neuronal oscillators. Collectively, these nodes form the components of a CoPG. Meanwhile, connectivity is determined by the relative degree of synchronization between neighboring cells.

recmUVx12qpeNnKOo,Merging control strategies for the manipulation of complex objects,"Skilful object manipulation often combines different movement elements to achieve specific task goals. When swirling a glass of wine, the primary goal of control is to bring the wine (internal degree of freedom) into a rhythmic circular motion, whereas when bringing the glass of wine to the mouth, the main goal is to translate the glass itself. Smooth transition of control goals, from rhythmic to discrete, or from internal to external degrees of freedom, exemplifies the remarkable dexterity in manipulation, yet remains hardly explored. 
This study developed a novel paradigm to examine how humans combine such control goals when manipulating an object with internal dynamics, akin to swirling a glass of wine. Subjects grasped the handle of a custom-designed cup with a ball rolling inside, and rhythmically ""swirled"" the ball close to the rim, while remaining within a specified ""home position"". An audible cue signalled subjects to translate the cup in a reach-like movement to a target position. Such discrete translation could interrupt the ball rotation or cause the ball to fall out. Subjects were instructed to keep the ball rotation as steady as possible during and after the reach. Dependent measures were the amplitude and frequency of ball rotation and their deviation/error from a perfect circular motion, the ball phase when initiating the translation, and the duration of the translation.
With practice, subjects achieved smooth transitions between rhythmic (ball) and discrete (cup) movements by jointly modulating the ball phase at translation initiation, and the duration of the translation. These findings suggest that the motor system learns to merge the control goals by integrating the discrete cup movement into the rhythmic cycle of the ball rotation. The observed behaviour is discussed in the context of optimal control theory and dynamic primitives for the control of complex actions.

recmapB0bDSZ2Hj7z,The Molecular Mechanisms of Ethanol Cognitive Neuroadaptations,"Alcohol consumption is known to induce cognitive impairments mainly affecting executive functions, episodic memory, and other capacities related to brain function. Nevertheless, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying such interactions is still unknown. Recent evidence has uncovered a similar interaction between ethanol exposure and cognitive function in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which opens the way for molecular studies in a genetically tractable model system.  Using an olfactory conditioning assays where an odorant is used as a conditioned stimulus (CS) and is paired with a heat shock used as an unconditioned stimulus (US), it was shown that Drosophila larvae can learn to avoid the odor in future exposures. However, when the animals are exposed to a short acute dose of alcohol, they are no longer able to learn this association. Interestingly, larvae that have undergone prolonged chronic ethanol exposure seem to successfully avoid the odorant paired with the heat shock just as well as control ethanol-naive larvae, which is suggestive of ethanol-induced neuroadaptations. Our aim is to understand the genetic and cellular components responsible for this adaptation. For this, we employ RNA Sequencing technology to evaluate differences in gene expression in the brain of larvae chronically exposed to ethanol and in control larvae. Results from RNA sequencing suggest neuroadaptations are modulated by a diverse array of synaptic proteins within the larvae brain. With the knowledge obtained from this study, we could be able to understand ethanol’s effect on learning and memory and gain an insight into how addiction may be contributing to damages in this behavior.

recmclaXnlBxUMVYf,Comparing 7T sequences to image human basal ganglia activity during performance on a visual cueing task,"Although it is well established that expectations influence visual selection, our mapping of the neurophysiological infrastructure that instantiates this influence remains incomplete. Two known influences on visual selection; probabilistic and value-based learning, have been associated with the function of the human basal ganglia, yet the sensitivity of these nuclei to visual selection demands remains unknown. Imaging the activity of the basal-ganglia is a challenge, as the iron-rich nuclei suffer signal loss when using conventional imaging sequences. We therefore sought to determine which echo-planar imaging (EPI) parameters yield the best signal in the basal ganglia when participants perform a visual cueing task that pits spatial probabilities against reward incentives in relation to upcoming visual targets. We compared three sequences designed for use with 7T Magnetic Resonance Imaging, that sought to balance high spatial and temporal resolution with full brain coverage, varying in slice acceleration factors and echo times. Importantly, we compared the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between sequences when both spatial probabilities and incentive-values influenced upcoming target discrimination performance, and when comparing the hand of response, which is in-line with the typical contrast used to determine optimal parameters for imaging the basal ganglia. We find that the sequence that provides the best CNR under varying visual selection manipulations is not the same as that found for the motoric contrast. Therefore, optimal imaging parameters for the basal ganglia during experiments that assess visual and cognitive manipulations may differ from the optimal parameters for imaging motoric-related activity.

recmgQQ7aAGFdisTH,Are colour experiences equivalent across the visual field?,"Perplexingly, our naïve impression of a vividly coloured experience across the visual field is challenged on empirical and theoretical grounds. Empirically, recent findings that subjects can be unaware of extensive desaturation of their peripheral vision demonstrates that our experiences have no guarantee of accuracy with respect to the external world (veridicality). Theoretically, objective verification of colour experience is hampered by claims that some subjective properties of experience are private and incommunicable. As a result, the connection between internal colour experience and external light properties seems arbitrary. This is epitomised by the ""inverted qualia"" argument, which posits the plausibility of different wavelength-experience mappings between individuals (e.g. colour inversion).
 
Here, we tested a reduced version of this claim by searching for evidence of colour inversion from central to peripheral vision within subjects. We sought to determine this by obtaining subjective similarity judgments between pairs of colours presented at varying eccentricities. We deemed colour experiences equivalent if stimuli presented at different eccentricities elicited equivalent similarity relationships.  We tested for the possibility of inversion by seeing whether artificially swapping peripheral colour labels during analysis would decrease these correlations. Additionally, we investigated whether the presence/absence of accounting for cortical magnification by using stimuli scaled by eccentricity affected these similarity judgments.
 
Using dissimilarity analysis, we found that the similarity judgments between experiences induced by coloured stimuli were highly correlated regardless of the eccentricity of presentation. Our preliminary analysis suggests that swapping the colour labels (e.g. inversion) produced detectable decreases in correlations between central and peripheral dissimilarity judgments. Additionally, we found that similarity judgments between experiences induced by unscaled (but not scaled) stimuli decreased in correlation as stimulus size decreased. 
 
These results do not support the possibility of colour inversion across the visual field and instead suggest the equivalence of central and peripheral colour experiences, irrespective of veridicality.

recmid0ikOgzvM6Os,Biophysically grounded mean-field models of neural populations under electrical stimulation,"Electrical stimulation of neural systems is a key tool for understanding neural dynamics and ultimately for developing clinical treatments. Many applications of electrical stimulation affect large populations of neurons. However, computational models of large networks of spiking neurons are inherently hard to simulate and analyze. 

We evaluate a reduced mean-field model of excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neurons which can be used to efficiently study the effects of electrical stimulation on large neural populations. The rich dynamical properties of this basic cortical model are described in detail and validated using large network simulations. Bifurcation diagrams reflecting the network's state reveal asynchronous up- and down-states, bistable regimes, and oscillatory regions corresponding to fast excitation-inhibition and slow excitation-adaptation feedback loops. The biophysical parameters of the AdEx neuron can be coupled to an electric field with realistic field strengths which then can be propagated up to the population description.

We show how on the edge of bifurcation, direct electrical inputs cause network state transitions, such as turning on and off oscillations of the population rate. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain and phase-lock endogenous oscillations. Relatively weak electric field strengths on the order of 1 V/m are able to produce these effects, indicating that field effects are strongly amplified in the network. The effects of time-varying external stimulation are well-predicted by the mean-field model, further underpinning the utility of low-dimensional neural mass models.

recmjTd6R8apespQC,Can we strategically reallocate memory resources?,"We can selectively prioritize information during perception. In working memory, information can be similarly prioritized by a retro-cue. This is thought to occur due to reallocation of resources to prioritized items. Here we tested this by employing a working memory task with unequal item rewards to create uneven distribution of resources. Retro-cues then indicated which of three items could be dropped from memory. If reallocation occurs, then we should observe a larger benefit in memory when a high reward item versus a low reward item becomes irrelevant, since high reward items tie up more resources. We found that participants use both reward value and cue information to perform the task. There is better performance for items with higher reward values, F(2,90) = 10.85, p < .001, and for valid versus neutral cues, F(1,45) = 16.38, p < .001. However, our results show that removing a well-encoded item does not benefit performance more, t(45) = 0.05, p = .959 (JZS Bayes Factor = 6.245683). These findings challenge the dominant view that retro-cue benefits reflect reallocation of memory resources from removed items. Our results are more consistent with a benefit to cued items (such as retrieval protection or a general strengthening) that is independent of the memory strength of the de-prioritized item.

recmmOpj9Kii6uI2Q,"Alcohol addiction and Co-Morbid Adult Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder their correlation with Cardiac, Autonomic and Cognitive behavioral Response","Background and Rationale: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood 
neurodevelopmental disorder which has a relation with development of substance use disorders in 
adulthood. Physiological link and cognitive correlations between the two disorders may involves the
common network activities of the central autonomic network and frontal cortex. Hence there is a 
need for further research on the correlation between the cardiac, cognitive and behavioral 
parameters. 
Materials and Methods: This is a pilot study which is a part of PhD Study titled “Evaluation of 
Neurobiological correlates in men with co morbid alcohol use disorder and adult ADHD” and here are
preliminary results. 16 Study subjects (males and aged 18-50 years) admitted to deaddiction 
department of NIMHANS were divided into 2 groups with 8 subjects in each group: Alcohol use 
disorder (AUD) with/without comorbid Adult ADHD (AUD+AADHD) and compared with Healthy 
controls from hospital staff and students of NIMHANS. Study groups were subjected to 
Echocardiography, Conventional autonomic function tests, Pupillometry, Go No Go task, stop signal 
task and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigms.
Results: AUD and AUD+AADHD groups showed moderate to severe cardiac autonomic dysfunction, 
decreased values in parasympathetic activity, end systolic volume, decreased reaction time implying 
more impulsivity. Increased sample size might provide some hints on the correlation links between 
various neurobiological measures like cardiac Autonomic & Neurobehavioral dysfunction between 
Alcohol addiction & Adult ADHD compared to healthy controls.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the importance of neurobiological measures that exist between 
ADHD and substance use disorders and subsequent need of comprehensive study-based diagnosis for 
improvement of their quality of life.

Emerging computer vision-based pose estimation algorithms, built using neural networks, have extraordinary potential to automate and quantify the process of exercise training and injury prediction from videos. In this study, we build an automated pipeline with computer vision, machine learning and predictive modeling to translate weightlifting videos into insights and feedback without human overview. We first curated over 600 videos of people performing a deadlift from online forums along with natural language feedback provided by forum users in the form of over 1500 comments. Body pose information from these videos were obtained with the use of a computer vision-based pose estimation software called OpenPose. The pose data thus obtained was processed  using dynamic time warping so as to align and normalize the videos with each other in time and space for ease of comparison. Using unsupervised machine learning in the form of principal component analysis and k-nearest neighbours clustering, we automatically classify well performed deadlifts from poorly performed ones. Further, we outline a procedure using natural language processing to create a virtual trainer who provides interpretable feedback by analyzing the nature of deviations in the movements of a given video from example expert movements.

recn1O0ZJrk2b0gJS,Hand localization shifts after different types of visual error feedback in reaching,"Perturbed error feedback during reaching movements leads to adapted reaches, which involves at least two processes, as shown by a two-rate model (Smith et al., 2006). This model includes a fast and slow process, that respond differently to errors, and combine to change motor output, including those changes seen during rotated visual feedback training (McDougle et al., 2015). This model is specifically able to explain a rebound toward a previous performance when error feedback is removed. Adapting to rotated visual feedback also leads to shifted estimates of hand location, participants perceive their unseen hand as being closer to where they visually experienced the misaligned hand-cursor. Here we test how different types of feedback during training affect the rebound predicted by the two-rate model and shifts in proprioceptive-estimates of hand location. The feedback conditions include the typical continuous cursor feedback, and more “impoverished” conditions, terminal cursor feedback, and passive-exposure feedback. During rotated exposure feedback training, participants’ hands were moved by the robot with straight hand paths that perfectly countered any rotation, but with a normal error-clamp phase at the end. We find terminal cursor feedback produces a smaller rebound while the rebounds in the other conditions are indistinguishable. Regardless of the type of cursor feedback, perceived changes in hand location emerged very rapidly and with a similar time course throughout training across all three conditions. To further test the rapid changes in hand estimates, another group experienced a visuomotor rotation that changes every 12 trials. Participants attempted to learn each rotation with proprioceptive hand estimates again shifting quite rapidly following each change in rotation direction and size. However, the size of shift decrease slightly as training progressed, indicating a possible change in error sensitivity across time. These results underline the robustness and speed by which vision recalibrates proprioception. ",Jennifer Ruttle,"Jennifer Ruttle, York University; Bernard M.

recn6P1O1VPm0wnni,Analysis of EEG event-durations ,"Many EEG studies are analyzed using event-related potentials (ERP). But often, the experiments contains events of variable duration (e.g. reaction times, fixation durations, stimulus durations, movements). Due to a lack of analysis tools or plain unawareness, such durations are rarely modelled and typically a single ERP is calculated for all durations. This can lead to nonsensical, missleading or otherwise biased results, especially if event durations differ between conditions.

Using regression methods, I investigated this problem on real and simulated datasets. In the simulations, I systematically explore the effects of the ERP's waveform, different duration distributions, and noise, on multiple ways to model duration. Because varying event-durations co-ocur often with temporal overlap between events, I also investigate the influence of overlap and deconvolution based overlap-correction.

I conclude, that modelling event durations as a binned or linear predictor is not recommended. Non-linear effects can capture some of the patterns and are a promising candidate for further study.

Also, it contains non perfectly tuned neurons, responding in a variable way. Yet can robustly discriminate and maintain memoranda in working memory (WM). We investigate the effect of synaptic and dendritic mechanisms, in a PFC model network during a WM task simulation, to establish a link between these mechanisms and discrimination and maintenance of WM memoranda. 
We propose the dendritic and synaptic inhomogeneity patterns between PFC pyramidals as a complementary mechanism for flexible coding in PFC, sufficient for performing stimulus dependent shifts of network activity, ultimately to be utilized downstream for different behavior. We do so by probing the spatial arrangement of synaptic inputs on a variable number of dendrites. Finally, we explore the structured, highly reciprocal PFC connectivity as an optimal neural connectivity substrate, best exploiting the dendritic and synaptic inhomogeneities for the above-mentioned computations. 
Our results show that the combination of dendritic and synaptic inhomogeneities and structured, highly reciprocal connectivity can enable a single PFC recurrent network model to rapidly discriminate and maintain memoranda, despite the variable individual neuronal responses. We report that the network can rapidly shift between different transient, yet robustly discriminable activity trajectories, that are maintained during post-stimulus epoch. Also, we show that the above connectivity predicts the best PFC WM storage ability, compared with a non-optimal i.e. non-biologically correct network connectivity.

To  achieve  this goal, we first constructed and trained a biophysically constrained RNN model to perform a probabilistic decision-making task similar to the paradigm used in the human data.  Specifically, the training environment was probabilistic such that one stimulus was more probable than the others. We show that both humans and the RNN model successfully extract information about stimulus probability and integrate this knowledge into their decisions and task strategy in a new environment. Specifically, performance of both humans and the RNN model varied with the degree to which the stimulus probability of the new environment matched the formed expectations. In both humans and RNNs, this expectation effect was more prominent when the strength of sensory evidence was low. These findings suggest that both humans and our RNN model placed more emphasis on prior expectations (top-down signals) when the available sensory information (bottom-up signals) was limited.

However, a large number of studies have shown that uncommon sharing behavior could still be observed in the condition of resource scarcity. It’s unclear how resource sharing persists under shortage. In the present study, we suggested that empathy has accounted for the inconsistent and heterogeneous results in literatures of sharing decision. Here we combined a novel within-subject paradigm- participant who own resource decided whether and how to share their survival resources with the other participant who has no resource-with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and intranasal oxytocin to characterize the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of sharing behavior under resource scarcity. At the behavioral level, we found that people kept more resources for themselves under insufficient condition relative to sufficient condition. And the stability of sharing behavior was significantly correlated with the cognitive empathy(CE) score (r = -0.48, p < 0.01). At the neural level, we found activation in the left and right temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) were suppressed while the bilateral inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) were enhanced in insufficient condition comparing to sufficient condition. Psychophysiological Interactions (PPI) further suggested that the functional connectivity from lIOG to rTPJ was positively associated with the stability of sharing behavior. Oxytocin experiment provided evidence that high CE participants receiving oxytocin showed a lower changing rate than those receiving placebo while the low CE participants show no oxytocin effect. These findings suggest cognitive empathy trait and the lIOG-rTPJ neural connectivity play a crucial role in maintaining the stability of sharing behavior under scarcity, and oxytocin may strengthen the relationship between the two.",Xiaoxuan Huang,"Jie Liu, School of Psychology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Ruolei Gu, 3.

recng1mAPXKJdOQkk,Validation of a Convolutional Neural Network Model for Spike Transformation Using a Generalized Functional Additive Model,"Identification of causal relationships of neural activity is one of the most important problems in neuroscience and neural engineering. Past work has shown that cognitive processes such as memory formation rely on transformations of spatio-temporal patterns of spikes across different neural populations. Such transformations are highly nonlinear dynamical, and cannot be captured by basic linear models. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) can capture complex nonlinearity and abstract low-level and high-level features in natural images via the use of deep layers of nonlinear activation functions. It thus holds the promise of modeling complex neural spike transformations underlying cognitive processes.
We treat spatio-temporal patterns of past input spikes as binary images and use a CNN to predict spiking in a single output neuron in a binary classification task. We generate synthetic data using a generalized functional additive model (GFAM) with multiple neurophysiologically inspired functions (kernels) and a probit link function that is passed to a threshold to produce a binary neural time series representing spikes. A sliding window generates binary training images from this time series that are passed to a CNN with multiple layers of convolution with filters convolving over the time domain to capture temporal nonlinearity. The CNN is able to achieve a high correlation between the predicted probability of spiking in the output neuron and the true probability of spiking in the output neuron for the data generated with a generalized functional additive model. The CNN is also able to recover the ground truth kernels used to generate the probability of spiking in the output neuron during synthetic data generation. Based on the CNN's validation via a GFAM, our current work includes validation of our approach with non-linear models using data generated with more complex nonlinear kernels.",Bryan Moore,"Dong Song, University of Southern California",University of Southern California (grid.42505.36),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-29 20:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 20:45:00+00:00,
recnmwaBQ1KGkkGUA,Right and Left Neglect are not Anatomically Homologous: A Voxel-Lesion Symptom Mapping Study,"Visuospatial neglect is a heterogenous syndrome which can occur following damage to either right or left hemisphere areas. This study employs voxel-lesion symptom mapping to identify the neural correlates of left and right egocentric and allocentric neglect in large, representative acute stroke cohort.
499 acute stroke survivors (age=71.6, 41.5% female) completed neuropsychological neglect assessment and routine clinical imaging. Similar to previous investigations, left egocentric and left allocentric neglect were associated with damage to distinct clusters of voxels within the posterior parietal and temporo-parietal junction areas. Unlike previous investigations, right egocentric neglect was found to most strongly associated with damage to ipsilateral voxels within the right parietal operculum and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Interestingly, the left hemisphere homologues of the areas implicated in left-lateralised egocentric neglect were not found to act as significant predictors of right egocentric neglect impairment (F(7,317)=1.041, R2=0.028, p=0.396). Right allocentric neglect was found to be most strongly associated with damage to the anterior division of the left parahippocampal gyrus. 
The results of this investigation suggest that right egocentric neglect should not be characterised as a consequence of damage to left-hemisphere homologues of the right hemisphere attentional systems.  These findings support the characterisation of visuospatial neglect as a heterogenous cluster of impairments rather than a unitary syndrome and provide novel insight into the neural correlates of spatial attention.

They are organized in a recurrent network, where the current head orientation is represented by a localized bump of neuronal activity. Path integration in the context of head direction cells is moving this bump of activity around the network respecting the animal's current head orientation, while using only self-motion cues. The one-dimensional ring attractor has been a popular approach to model the network of head direction cells, and one of the most long-lived attractor network models in Computational Neuroscience. Furthermore, this model has recently received experimental support in the fly's head direction system. However, it remains to date unclear how a path integrating circuit of head direction cells could self-organize through synaptic plasticity. Previous models showed circuits that either needed parameter tuning after training, or used biologically implausible learning rules.

reco29LTNR8x6sBDd,Metabolic state dependence of olfactory cortex flavor representation during binge eating in rodents,"Energy homeostasis is achieved by the complex regulatory network that involves a feedback circuit between dietary intake behavior and nutritional state. The uncoupling of dietary intake and nutritional state results in overeating. Hedonic overeating can escalate into binge eating, a heritable trait associated with binge eating disorder and bulimia. One factor that modulates this feedback loop is the sensory perception of flavors. Olfaction is a critical element of flavor perception and greatly influences the qualitative and hedonic evaluation of food items. Patients with olfactory chemosensory deficits commonly report a reduced appreciation of food items. Current evidence suggests that upon fasting, the olfactory system is necessary for triggering fasting-induced overeating. However, it is unclear how adaptations related to binge eating are reflected by the olfactory flavor responses. 

To understand the relationship between olfactory perception and binging, we developed an overeating behavioral paradigm that repeatedly delivers hedonic food (flavored milk) to mice. Implementing this with a head-mount miniaturized microscope allows us to measure neural responses upon overeating in the olfactory cortex (piriform cortex) in freely moving mice. We found that during a binge eating bout, the majority (~90%) of excitatory piriform neurons are suppressed. Whether this implies the involvement of inhibitory neurons during binging and/or whether the flavor representation adapts during the escalation of binging are the next steps of our examination.

reco3S5XTRuPoRRuG,A speech planning network for interactive language use,"During conversation, people take turns speaking by rapidly responding to their partners while simultaneously avoiding interruption. Such interactions display a remarkable degree of coordination, as typical gaps between turns are ~200 ms – approximately the duration of an eyeblink. These response times are considerably shorter than those observed in simple word production tasks, indicating that speakers often plan their responses while they listen to their partners. Although a distributed network of brain regions has been implicated in speech planning, the neural dynamics underlying the specific preparatory processes which enable rapid turn-taking are poorly understood. Here we use intracranial electrocorticography to precisely measure rapidly evolving cortical activity associated with speech planning in participants performing interactive language tasks, and we isolate these dynamics to a spatially restricted planning network that is anatomically segregated from brain regions involved in speech perception and production. The core of this planning network is comprised of caudal inferior frontal gyrus (i.e., ‘Broca’s region’), which is crucial for language production, and caudal middle frontal gyrus, a region not normally implicated in speech planning. Using a series of motor tasks, we show that this planning circuit is selectively active when preparing speech but largely unrecruited when planning nonlinguistic orofacial and manual actions. We examine neural activity while participants engage in natural conversation and isolate planning dynamics that are largely identical to those observed our interactive tasks. Finally, we find that electrical stimulation of sites displaying planning activity can significantly lengthen the time until the onset of the opposing speaker’s turn and result in characteristic errors in responses. Taken together, identification of this speech planning circuit advances our understanding of naturalistic language generation by uncovering cortical dynamics central to spoken communication.",Michael Long ,,NYU,"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Keynote Event,2020-10-29 19:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 20:00:00+00:00,
reco86Bwc5TGjDNEX,What is it like to have a disorder of consciousness? Interpreting neural measures of conscious “level”,"Disorders of consciousness (DOC) pose a significant clinical and ethical challenge because they allow for complex forms of conscious experience in patients where behavioural responses and communication are highly limited or non-existent. We currently know very little about what it is like to have a DOC, but richer information about the lived conscious experience of these patients could positively influence research and practice. For example, such knowledge may inform welfare-improving decisions about treatment, rehabilitation, social interaction and environmental enhancements for DOC patients. There has been considerable research into neuroscientific measures that could provide further insight by quantitatively assessing an unresponsive individual’s conscious “level” based on neural data. However, there is a growing consensus that consciousness is a multidimensional phenomenon and that unidimensional measures cannot capture all relevant kinds of variation in DOC consciousness. It remains unclear which dimensions of consciousness these unidimensional neural measures may reflect. 
Given the paucity of subjective reports about DOC consciousness, I propose that to make progress on this question, we can investigate how neural measures behave in other conscious states where subjective reports are available (like sleep, psychedelic experiences, and anaesthesia). I survey such evidence for neural measures of consciousness and based on this, I argue that these measures may often be sensitive to particular features of consciousness, like sensory richness and unconstrained mental activity, but cannot be thought to index conscious level per se. These neural measures, if conceived of and applied as markers of specific conscious or neurocognitive properties, may offer significant insight into the subjective quality of DOC experience and as such may inform treatment and welfare related decisions for this patient group.",Jasmine Walter,,Monash University (grid.1002.3),"Theme F: History, Education and Society",Traditional talk,2020-10-28 06:30:00+00:00,2020-10-28 06:45:00+00:00,
reco9JjBOuBkUYMbV,Learning orthogonalizes visual cortical population codes,"A body of work argues that learning results in an increased representation of behaviorally relevant stimuli in cortex; however, understanding how learning changes population codes requires simultaneously recording large neural populations. To clarify the effects of learning in primary visual cortex (V1), we recorded from thousands of neurons in V1 in response to passive drifting gratings before and after training on a novel orientation comparison task. 

In the task, two gratings were presented simultaneously, each one of three orientations (45°, 68°, and 90°). Mice were rewarded for choosing 45° or rejecting 90°. Thus, 45° and 90° informed what action the mouse should take while 68° was a distractor. 

Task training affected orientation tuning curves in unexpected ways: a reduction in the number of neurons preferring the informative orientations (45° and 90°), asymmetric tuning curves, and suppression of responses to both informative orientations, most notably for weakly tuned neurons. 

These multifarious effects on tuning curves could be explained by a simple principle: sparsening of the population for informative orientations. This increase in population sparseness orthogonalized the population codes for informative stimuli to each other and to all other orientations (i.e., increased the angle between the population rate vectors). 

To elucidate the possible biological mechanism underlying these learning effects, we developed a simple computational model, in which a top-down “importance signal” modulated neuronal F-I curves.  This model, which does not necessitate Hebbian-like plasticity, could successfully recapitulate the myriad impacts of learning on single-cell tuning curves by increasing population sparseness through F-I curve modulation. 

Our results show that learning sparsifies the representation of informative task stimuli in the brain, orthogonalizes their population codes, and may improve their differentiation by downstream regions of the brain.

The current study investigates how longitudinal changes of symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression relate to threat neurocircuitry. 

Participants aged 18-19 years (N=269, 183 female) were enrolled to ensure a range of scores on symptom measures related to threat and reward sensitivity. Subjects went through self-report measures of anxiety and depression at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 months. Symptom dimensions of general distress, fear, and anhedonic depression were estimated through a tri-level factorial model for each time point. Linear slopes were extracted for the change of symptom dimensions over time. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were obtained while participants performed Pavlovian fear acquisition, extinction, and extinction recall tasks at both baseline and 36 months. Neural activity in brain regions related to neural threat circuitry (e.g. amygdala, hippocampus, anterior insula) were extracted. 

Linear mixed models used to estimate relationships between the change of symptom dimensions over time and activation in neural threat circuitry revealed two major findings: (1) Neural threat reactivity during fear acquisition at baseline is positively associated with changes in fear symptoms over and above changes in general distress and anhedonia-apprehension, suggesting that greater sensitivity to fearful stimuli at baseline is associated with a greater increase in fear symptoms during the 3-year prospective period. (2) Neural responses to the extinguished stimulus during extinction recall at 36 months are negatively associated with changes in general distress, suggesting that greater increases in general distress over the 3 years are associated with deficits in extinction at 36 months. These findings show the promise of fMRI fear conditioning paradigms as a tool for classifying individuals into empirically established symptom profiles.

recoGLGrXQMuMwtZP,A circuit-based theory of the impact of cortical state on information flow,"Cortical state changes such as attention or arousal are a frequent topic of study as they allow for the inference of relationships between changes in cortical activity and behavior. Intuition for these links has been derived from how response properties often subject to cortical state modulation, like tuning and correlated variability, relate to information flow. However, despite the widespread use of these results in unpacking experimental observations, it remains to fully consider how modulation of cortical state affects stimulus processing. To this end we look at the effect of cortical state on information flow in cortical circuit models and find that linear Fisher information does not change with cortical state if the operating regime of cortex is well-described by a linear response function. This is because any state-dependent changes in response gain are canceled by changes in population variability. We show that if one restricts a decoder to a subset of a cortical population, information within the subpopulation can increase through modulation of cortical state. One clear example is that of excitatory and inhibitory cells in a network: only excitatory cells project along the cortical hierarchy, and are thereby the only targets of interest to a downstream decoder. Surprisingly, we find that only those cells which are not accessible to the decoder can modulate how information flow changes within the decoded population. Our theory additionally reveals a parametrically simplified and intuitive framework for analyzing the effects of modulation on information processing, thereby adding valuable insight into a widespread phenomenon across cortical networks.",Matt Getz (he/his),"Chengcheng Huang, University of Pittsburgh; Brent Doiron, University of Chicago",University of Chicago (grid.170205.1),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-29 22:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 22:15:00+00:00,

recoWvYIY5ADAOg5Z,Microsurgical lesions identify segmentally distinct responses of axotomized corticospinal neurons,"It remains well established that the intrinsic ability of neurons for axon regeneration declines with age. Despite significant work, we still do not precisely know how and when do neurons lose this intrinsic ability during development. This is because conventional models of injury produce an injury response and disrupt potential guidance cues required for axon growth. Such models cannot therefore precisely delineate the intrinsic ability of neurons for axon regrowth. We aimed to investigate intrinsic ability of axonal regeneration during development, at a time when appropriate guidance cues are still expressed in their appropriate context. To this end, we have established a novel, reproducible, approach to transect developing corticospinal neuron (CSN) axons in the neonatal spinal cord. In this new approach, the corticospinal tract (CST) is injured using a beveled micropipette vibrating at ultrasonic frequency. This results in minimal glial scarring, inflammation and leaves the spinal environment largely unperturbed. This therefore enables a clear, unambiguous investigation of the intrinsic ability of axon regeneration through development. Our results surprisingly indicate that CSN axon regenerative ability is not lost uniformly across the different segments of the same axon. Specifically, CSN axons injured at postnatal day 7 (P7) at caudal thoracic T11 can fully regenerate and extend to lumbar segments. In striking contrast, CSN axons, when injured at high cervical C2, at an even earlier time, P4, completely fail to extend across this micro-lesion. This surprising finding indicates that CSN axons lose their regenerative ability at distinct times at distinct spinal segments. This new approach will now enable molecular delineation of specific mechanisms controlling the decline of CSN regenerative ability. Further, this also suggests that distinct therapeutic approaches will be required to target CST regeneration after spinal injuries at different spinal segmental levels. Finally, this novel microsurgical approach can now be used to specifically test whether candidate molecules can increase the intrinsic ability of CSN to extend axons after spinal cord injury.",Carolin Ruven,"Vibhu Sahni, Ph.D.",Burke Medical Research Institute (grid.410373.2),"Theme A: Development, Neurodegenerative Disorders and Injury",Interactive talk,2020-10-27 21:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 21:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/RzMSrENG_G4

Here, we report that Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a molecular component of the postnatal SVZ, promotes radial glial cell maintenance and proliferation in an autocrine manner via Notch signaling. Loss of ET-1 signaling increases neurogenesis and reduces oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation (OPC) in the developing SVZ, thereby altering cellular output of the stem cell niche. We also show that ET-1 is required for increased neural stem cell and OPC proliferation in the adult mouse SVZ following demyelination. Lastly, high levels of ET-1 in the SVZ of patients with Cathepsin A-related arteriopathy with strokes and leukoencephalopathy correlate with an increased number of SVZ OPCs, suggesting ET-1's role as a regulator of glial progenitor proliferation may be conserved in humans.

Previous studies showed that dance-based learning over 8-months produced BOLD signal changes in SMA using fMRI (Bar & DeSouza 2016) and resting state alpha power increases in frontal cortex post-dance in people with Parkinson’s disease compared to controls (Levkov et al 2014). 
Our current project assesses the impact of motor learning while subjects (n=16) learn a 30-second choreography. Trials include watching VIDEO (4 times), watching LIVE performances of the choreography (6 times), moving with the teacher (LEARN; 6 to 20 times), imagining performing from a first-person perspective (IMAGINE; 6 times), and finally performing in space (PERFORM; 6 times).  Sessions were recorded at the Berlin Mobile Brain/Body Imaging lab (BeMoBIL) which allows for acquisition of motion capture data synced with continuous recording of wireless mobile EEG (Brain Products ActiCap; 128 electrodes) in a dedicated 150 m2 lab space Movements are measured using 10 HTC Vive trackers running on Steam VR; music was rated for valence pre/post learning. 
Preliminary results show a significant shift (p=.0009) in participants’ affective scoring of the music post-learning, suggesting that the experience of dance learning impacts perception of previously unfamiliar music. This is important, as music is a consistent factor in rehabilitation programs using dance; however, to this point, the effects of motor learning on affective music perception have not been studied in this context.  Additionally, all participants reached our target of 80% or higher accuracy in reproducing the movement sequence within 20 LEARN trials, with expertise correlating to fewer trials. Next steps include frequency analysis of EEG data pre/post and during learning, along with movement analysis to determine the contribution of motor learning to observed brain-based changes.

Here, we constructed functional brain networks from Electroencephalography (EEG) data in the perisaccadic interval. Then, we evaluated the topological and spectral properties of the perisaccadic network. EEG was recorded via 64 channels in two behavioral conditions (fixation and saccade). Participants (N=21) were pre-cued with a series 1-3 grids (three horizontal lines, 10° by 10°) located 5° below the central fixation-point. In the saccade condition, saccades (recorded by Electrooculography) were cued by a sudden shift of the fixation-point to 10° left/right. 100ms later, a stimulus (three vertical lines; same size/location) was briefly presented (for 70ms). Saccades were occurred after the stimulus presentation. Fixation condition was identical, except the fixation-point remained in the centre. LORETA source localization was performed on the 200ms period following the saccade cue, or the equivalent time during fixation trials. Lagged coherences were calculated between all pairs of 84 Brodmann areas. Graph theory analysis (GTA) was implemented to find clustering coefficient (C), global efficiency (E), energy (H), entropy (S). Nonparametric permutation test showed higher values for C, E, H, and S in all frequency bands for the saccade task (relative to the fixation task). These results suggest that the segregation, integration, synchronizability, and complexity of brain network were simultaneously enhanced during the perisaccadic interval (in comparison to the fixation). The increased network properties can suggest a mechanism for high-level information processing (that is related to increased entropy in the network) and high-speed information propagation (that is associated with higher energy, clustering coefficient, and efficiency in the network) during the perisaccadic interval.

RNNs can be trained, using deep learning methods, to perform cognitive tasks used in animal and human experiments, and can be studied to investigate potential neural representations and circuit mechanisms underlying cognitive computations and behavior. Widespread application of these approaches within neuroscience has been limited by technical barriers in use of deep learning software packages to train network models. Here we introduce PsychRNN, an accessible, flexible, and extensible Python package for training RNNs on cognitive tasks. Our package is designed for accessibility, for researchers to define tasks and train RNN models using only Python and NumPy without requiring knowledge of deep learning software. The training backend is based on TensorFlow and is readily extensible for researchers with TensorFlow knowledge to develop projects with additional customization. PsychRNN implements a number of specialized features to support applications in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Users can impose neurobiologically relevant constraints on synaptic connectivity patterns. Furthermore, specification of cognitive tasks has a modular structure, which facilitates parametric variation of task demands to examine their impact on model solutions. PsychRNN also enables task shaping during training, or curriculum learning, in which tasks are adjusted in closed-loop based on performance. Shaping is ubiquitous in training of animals in cognitive tasks, and PsychRNN allows investigation of how shaping trajectories impact learning and model solutions.

recoqge6uPIZtB0oC,The gradient of population receptive field stimulus-dependence in ventral visual cortex,"Regions of ventral occipito-temporal (VOT) visual cortex are more responsive to written words than other categories of visual stimuli. We refer to these regions as the VOT reading circuitry (VOTRC). The population receptive field (pRF) of a voxel is the portion of the visual field in which stimuli evoke a response. The pRFs of voxels in the VOTRC are stimulus-dependent (Le et al., 2017). Measured with word stimuli, the pRF centers are mainly confined to the central visual field (with a clear contralateral bias); measured with checkerboard stimuli, the pRF centers span a wider range of locations,  extending to the periphery. To understand this stimulus dependence, we analyzed pRFs in visual field-maps (V1-3, hV4, VO1) whose signals are the likely inputs to the VOTRC. We measured pRFs in 34 subjects (20 only English; 14 Hebrew/English) using the moving bar paradigm with several types of contrast patterns within the bar (checkerboards, English and Hebrew words of different sizes, false fonts). We found that stimulus dependence emerges gradually along the visual field map hierarchy. The stimulus dependence is small in visual areas V1 and V2, becoming more pronounced in V3, hV4, and VO-1. The pRF center can be expressed in Cartesian [x,y] or Polar [eccentricity,angle] coordinates. The largest variation in stimulus dependence is the eccentricity of the pRF center; the angle remains relatively constant. Given that the pRF position is stimulus dependent, it may be important to use the relevant stimulus when using pRFs to model the visual components of different tasks. With an interest in reading development, it seems best to use word stimuli in a legible orthography.

recp6TCFKu8sGP6en,Is the Kiki-Bouba effect specific to pronounceable words?,"INTRODUCTION. Across cultures, people associate spiky shapes to the word “Kiki” and rounded shapes to the word “Bouba”. What causes this highly systematic shape-sound association? One possibility is that our mouth forms an angular shape while uttering the word “Kiki” and circular shape while saying “Bouba”. Alternatively, objects with sharp edges produce high-pitched (“Kiki”-like) sounds while those with rounded edges produce low-pitched (“Bouba”-like) sounds. Repeated cross-modal experiences could enable learning this association. Here, we investigated the reason behind this effect using a series of behavioral experiments.

METHODS. We conducted four online behavioral experiments using Google Forms. Ten spiky and ten rounded shapes were created. In Experiments 1 & 2, subjects had to associate each shape to a Kiki-like or Bouba-like word. In Experiment 3 & 4, multiple audio clips were played and subjects had to associate them with either a spiky or a rounded shape. The audio clips were either (1) pronounceable Kiki & Bouba words; (2) the same words but reversed in time so that they were no longer pronouncable, but contained the same sound frequencies; (3) pure tones matched to the mean frequency of the Kiki and Bouba words; and (4) Sounds produced by natural objects when struck.

RESULTS. In the shape-validation experiment, 80% of the subjects associated spiky shapes with Kiki-like words and rounded shapes with Bouba-like words. In Experiments 3 & 4, subjects associated Bouba-like words with rounded shapes (~85%), Kiki-like words with spiky shapes(~60%), reversed Bouba words with rounded shapes (~85%), reversed Kiki words with spiky shapes (~55%), metal clanks with spiky shapes (~90%) and pillow hits with rounded shapes (~55%). There was a strong positive correlation between mean frequency of sound and the Kiki-ness of the word.

CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the Kiki-Bouba effect reflects a robust association between shapes and sound frequency irrespective of whether the sounds can be pronounced.",Ananya Passi,"SP Arun, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore",Indian Institute of Science Bangalore (grid.34980.36),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-30 11:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 11:30:00+00:00,
recpBuY9DSWfmHPvi,Representing Altruism in Multi-agent Theory of Minds,"Research on multi-agent theory of minds assumes that each agent is motivated by the maximization of either their own utility, or their team's collective utility. There is a significant gap in our understanding of how to represent perceived unselfish behavior in social interactions with multiple people and objectives. We address this gap by utilizing a multi-agent theory of minds framework and three-player stag hunt game to simulate a situation where social cooperation can only be inferred from other agent's actions. In addition to normal game actions, each agent has actions that allow them to advertise and elicit social preferences.  Agents can declare their altruistic intentions towards any other agent, without committing to altruistic gameplay. To elicit social preferences, each agent has the ability to make any other agent play the dictator game. The dictator game allows the agents to signal whether they are purely self-interested, or actually altruistic at a cost to the agent. Preliminary results without the dictator game show that higher level agents are more likely to declare altruism, and that an agent's altruistic declarations had a notable effect on the inferred teams and the other agents' following actions. We aim to utilize this environment to conduct experiments with depressed and nondepressed participants, in order to better understand how depression affects the perception of social cooperation and altruism.

Cerebellar Ataxia; Motor Learning; Exercise; Neuroplasticity; Neurorehabilitation; Reliability; Feasibility

Background: 
Impairments in gait and balance are hallmark symptoms for individuals with spinocerebellar Ataxias (SCAs) and they contribute to functional limitations including fall risk and loss of independent ambulation.  Rehabilitation interventions hold great promise for improving physical function and delaying disease progression, however research specifically in SCA remains limited, especially so for remote or hybrid delivered interventions. Recent literature supports priming aerobic exercise can enhance task-specific motor performance in individuals with neurological disorders. Activation of neural circuitries following aerobic exercise may lead to downstream retention of cognitive and motor skills, and may provide a crucial link to enhancing motor performance and facilitating motor learning in individuals with SCAs. Exercise interventions are therefore optimally positioned as both a method to improve motor symptoms and slow disease progression, as well as to evaluate the responsiveness of outcome measures for use in a range of clinical trials. Establishing the feasibility of a remotely delivered motor-priming exercise intervention is crucial to support clinical trial readiness. 

Aims: 
1.To determine the reliability and responsiveness of a remotely-administered standardized clinical outcome battery in individuals with SCA.  
2.To determine the feasibility of delivering a remotely-delivered 8-week high intensity exercise intervention in individuals with SCAs. 

Methods: 
The proposed aims will be nested in a single cohort study evaluating an 8-week remotely-delivered exercise intervention for individuals with genetically-confirmed SCAs (n=20). The intervention will be delivered twice a week for 8 weeks and consist of combined 30-minute high intensity interval training (HIIT) on a recumbent stationary cycle ergometer, followed immediately by intensive, individualized 20-minute balance training. A caregiver/support person will be required for engagement in intervention sessions. Participants and their caregiver/support person will be instructed in identifying a space at home to sufficiently and safely perform tests/interventions. Participants will use FitBit Wearable Activity Monitors with heart rate capabilities as a method to evaluate exercise intensity and duration. Remotely-administered standardized outcome battery will be conducted during two baseline assessments (1 week apart), mid-intervention (week 5) and post intervention (week 8) and will include the first 4-items of the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), Cerebellar Cognitive Assessment Scale (CCAS), Neurologic Quality of Life (NeuroQOL), Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) and measures of postural sway through a smartphone app (Encephalog, Mon4t, LLC, Binyamina, Israel). To determine the test-retest reliability of the remotely-administered standardized clinical outcome battery, we will calculate intraclass correlation coefficients as well as minimal detectable change values. To determine the responsiveness of the outcome battery, we will calculate the effect estimates comparing baseline, mid-intervention and post intervention. To determine the feasibility of delivering a high intensity exercise intervention remotely, we will evaluate the safety, retention and adherence rates.  

Results/Conclusion: Participants are currently being recruited for this study. 

Clinical Implications: This project will provide knowledge on the feasibility of measuring clinical outcomes and delivering an exercise intervention remotely while additionally developing physiological and functional biomarkers for clinical trial readiness in SCA.

recpG8alDSqNkpdVs,Data Quality metrics to improve EEG / ERP research - the Standardized Measurement Error SME,"Using EEG / ERP data allows non-invasive brain recording with high temporal precision.It is well understood that signal-to-noise ratio is key in EEG / ERP data. While removing periods with artifacts and “noisy” subjects should generally improve this signal-to-noise ratio, the nature of this improvement is often poorly quantified.

Despite this, there is no widely accepted metric of ERP data quality.

Here, we propose a concrete, reportable, auto-documented, heuristic approach for assessing data quality in averaged ERPs.

We build upon 'standard error' (SE) as a well understood measure, and formalize a specific procedure for applying SE to ERPs, called 'Standardized Measurement Error' (SME). We implement this by declaring, for a given analysis, the ERP score measure type (say, 'Mean Amplitude'), and the time window of interest (say, 300 to 400 ms). With that, 

SME(score,time_period)= std_dev(score_value) / n_valid_epochs

A higher number indicates higher ‘spread’ or higher standard error, specifically at the score measure and time period of interest. We suggest that extensive use and reporting of SME would allow better calibration of researchers in assessing data quality. We include automatic calculation, saving, and parameter reporting of SME in our ERPLAB processing toolbox.

recpHDSdKQwkU0xNd,Parallel ascending spinal pathways for affective touch and pain,"Each day we experience myriad somatosensory stimuli: hugs from loved ones, warm showers, a mosquito bite, and sore muscles after a workout. These tactile, thermal, itch, and nociceptive signals are detected by peripheral sensory neuron terminals distributed throughout our body, propagated into the spinal cord, and then transmitted to the brain through ascending spinal pathways. Primary sensory neurons that detect a wide range of somatosensory stimuli have been identified and characterized. In contrast, very little is known about how peripheral signals are integrated and processed within the spinal cord and conveyed to the brain to generate somatosensory perception and behavioral responses. We tackled this question by developing new mouse genetic tools to define projection neuron (PN) subsets of the anterolateral pathway, a major ascending spinal cord pathway, and combining these new tools with advanced anatomical, physiological, and behavioral approaches. We found that Gpr83+ PNs, a newly identified subset of spinal cord output neurons, and Tacr1+ PNs are largely non-overlapping populations that innervate distinct sets of subnuclei within the lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBNL) of the pons in a zonally segregated manner. In addition, Gpr83+ PNs are highly sensitive to cutaneous mechanical stimuli, receive strong synaptic inputs from primary mechanosensory neurons, and convey tactile information bilaterally to the PBNL in a non-topographically organized manner. Remarkably, Gpr83+ mechanosensory limb of the anterolateral pathway controls behaviors associated with different hedonic values (appetitive or aversive) in a scalable manner. This is the first study to identify a dedicated spinal cord output pathway that conveys affective touch signals to the brain and to define parallel ascending circuit modules that cooperate to convey tactile, thermal and noxious cutaneous signals from the spinal cord to the brain. This study has also revealed exciting new therapeutic opportunities for developing treatments for neurological disorders associated with pain and affective touch.",Seungwon (Sebastian) Choi,"Junichi Hachisuka, University of Pittsburgh; Matthew A.

recpHdKYOeRAbxBcJ,A detailed computational model of thalamic and cortical microcircuits based on inference in a generative vision model,"Understanding the information processing roles of cortical circuits is an outstanding problem in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Theory-driven efforts will be required to tease apart the functional logic of cortical circuits from the vast amounts of experimental data on cortical connectivity and physiology. Although the theoretical setting of Bayesian inference has been suggested as a framework for understanding cortical computation, making precise and falsifiable biological mappings need models that tackle the challenge of real world tasks. Based on a recent generative model, Recursive Cortical Networks, that demonstrated excellent performance on visual task benchmarks, we derive a family of anatomically instantiated and functional cortical circuit models. Efficient inference and generalization guided the representational choices in the original computational model. The cortical circuit model is derived by systematically comparing the computational requirements of this model with known anatomical constraints. The derived model suggests precise functional roles for the feed-forward, feedback, and lateral connections observed in different laminae and columns, assigns a computational role for the path through the thalamus, predicts the interactions between blobs and inter-blobs, and offers an algorithmic explanation for the innate inter-laminar connectivity between clonal neurons within a cortical column. The model also explains several visual phenomena, including the subjective contour effect, and neon-color spreading effect, with circuit-level precision.

This test is useful for investigating differences in auditory processing in developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The larval zebrafish is uniquely useful for non-invasive in vivo imaging of the whole brain at the cellular level. It therefore presents an opportunity to investigate MMN responses at the single-cell level. We used selective plane illumination microscopy to record fluorescent responses to auditory oddball stimulus trains in the brains of zebrafish larvae expressing GCamP6. Preliminary tests reveal certain populations of neurons do show elevated responses to oddball stimuli, and that pure tones are more effective for producing this effect than bands of white noise.

recpY9rro8R4xYSm2,Face processing in ecologically valid scenes:  Characterizing fixation related ERPs under free-viewing conditions,"Classically, the physiological mechanisms of face perception are studied under restricted, lab-based conditions. Specifically, visual stimuli are passively presented, no eye movements are allowed, and the timing is under the control of the experimenter, not the participant. While this approach yields high experimental control over factors influencing the signal of interest, it lacks natural validity. Here, we investigate whether we can replicate the N170, a face-sensitive ERP observed in classic experiments, in a free-viewing paradigm using natural scenes.
First, we use a passive control-condition to replicate the classical N170 findings. The same participants then view images taken from a head-camera in a local shopping center under free-viewing conditions. We model our data using the unfold toolbox, which also corrects for overlap effects and co-varying non-linear dependencies on different eye movement parameters. Additionally, we extend the analysis beyond classically electrode sites and time windows by employing TFCE.
In the classic setup, we replicate the face-object N170 contrast. In the free-viewing condition, we find a similar effect, but additionally, the amplitude of the P100 is also increased when a face is fixated. Underlining the usefulness of the more natural free-viewing approach the N170 face-effect correlates between the passive and active condition (r=0.78), and the variability within the subjects is decreased under free-viewing conditions. Interestingly, when looking at fERPs assigned by the category of the previous fixation, we find more positive fERPs for fixations originating from a face, even before fixation onset. This indicates an adaptation effect when moving from one to the next fixation. This effect becomes even stronger for two consecutive fixations within a face.

In summary, we demonstrate the feasibility of an ecologically valid study of face processing, uncovering neural aspects previously remaining unnoticed.

recpbRMWvqe6Molll,Disrupted experience-dependent place cell coding in rats heterozygous for the calcium channel gene Cacna1c,"Genome-wide association studies reveal that variants of CACNA1C, a gene encoding the α1 pore-forming subunit of the L-Type calcium channel, confer risk for psychiatric disorders across diagnostic categories. Heterozygosity for this gene in rodents has been associated with hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits and related cognitive impairment. What is not yet known however, is how synaptic deficits disrupt neuronal and network activity to compromise behavioural function. We sought to bridge this gap by quantifying place-cell dynamics in Cacna1c heterozygous (Cacna1c+/-) rats. 
We recorded dorsal CA1 single unit and local field potential activity in adult Cacna1c+/- rats during free exploration of familiar and novel environments, and during rest. Place-fields were normal in a novel environment yet enlarged on a linear track in Cacna1c+/- rats, with an associated reduction of place-cell spatial information. During rest, despite intact sharp-wave ripple oscillations, Cacna1c+/- rats exhibited overexcitation of place-cells during ripples. In contrast, cross-correlated activity between place-cell pairs during ripples was markedly impaired. In addition, a loss of correlation between spike-timing and place-field distance between cell pairs during ripples was observed during the rest period following free exploration in Cacna1c+/- rats, indicating an impairment in ripple-associated reactivation of spatial codes.
These results point towards a deficit in the consolidation of spatial memory in Cacna1c+/- rats, possibly arising due to impairments in schaffer-collateral plasticity. Such deficits may underlie Cacna1c-associated behavioural impairments, highlighting a potential mechanism underlying cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disease.

recpbbxUN7aHf67Ir,Investigating brain development and neuronal circuit assembly in primary immunodeficiency WHIM syndrome models,"Chemokine signalling is essential for coordinated cell migration in multiple tissues and processes, and it is known to govern cell positioning in both physiological and pathological context. In particular, the relevance of CxCl12/CxCr4 axis has been extensively characterized in leukocytes migration and homing as well as tumour growth and invasion. In addition, the Cxcl12/Cxcr4 system has been centrally implicated in the developmental regulation of neuronal migration, in particular of GABAergic inhibitory neurons of cerebral cortex and the cerebellum (Purkinje cells). 
WHIM syndrome is a rare form of juvenile immunodeficiency characterized by Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent Infections and Myelokathexis, and it is caused by autosomal dominant CXCR4 mutation, which blocks the receptor internalization after Cxcl12 stimulation inducing the persistent activation of Cxcr4. WHIM patients are susceptible to potentially life-threatening bacterial, and to a less extent, to viral infections. The immunological signs of WHIM syndrome have been extensively investigated through the well-established genetic animal model, which faithfully recapitulates the immune phenotype. In this project, we aim at characterizing the effects of Cxcr4/Cxcl12 alterations on the development of the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum by integrating cellular, molecular and behavioural analysis of WHIM model. Our preliminary data suggest that GABAergic cortical and cerebellar systems are developmentally impaired in WHIM mice, at both molecular and morphological levels, with long lasting detrimental effects on neuronal wiring and socio-motor behaviours. It is compelling that the first neuro-psychological assessment of WHIM patients correlates with our experimental in vivo results. Thus, we aim at investigating the pathological mechanisms underlying these defects, to evaluate the neuronal phenotype- for long overlooked- and, ultimately identify specific therapeutic approaches for WHIM syndrome in humans.

recpqRJFIeaLW5pxe,Online Replication of Age Effects in Two Variants of the Mnemonic Similarity Task,"Performance on The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) has been shown to be sensitive to age-related changes in medial temporal lobe function. The traditional MST has participants see a set of images during an encoding phase and then test their memory for these images in a test phase where participants must judge whether the images they are seeing are repetitions of previous images, similar images to those they saw, or completely new images. Age-related changes have been shown to relate to the ability to discriminate similar images (Lures) from previously seen images. This sensitivity has led to widespread use of the task, and several of its variants to probe age-related changes within the temporal lobes. However, whether these effects replicate in an online setting are currently unknown. 

In this study we used two online versions of the MST-Objects version (MST-O)  on an online sample of Older and Younger adults. Using both paradigms, we replicate previously reported age effects in the online setting. Specifically, and in line with lab-based studies, we see age-dependent effect on lure discrimination, while finding no such age effect on recognition abilities. Additionally, we were able to replicate a similarity-dependent effect on Lure Discrimination, where the more similar a Lure is to its original image, the less likely it is to be correctly identified, regardless of age group. We were also able to show that behavior in both tasks correlate across both online versions, showing that we are able to capture some meaningful individual differences. Both online versions of the MST-O captures similar behavior, and age-related differences to the lab-based experiments which opens up the potential for using the MST on larger and more diverse samples than are typically possible in lab-based experiments.

recq186GqXsbGbuz4,Improving brain-machine interface robustness through deep learning-based manifold alignment,"Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) can restore voluntary movements to people with paralysis by translating brain activity directly into the motion of an external device. A major barrier to the long-term usage of iBCIs is the inability of the algorithms, or “decoders”, that do this translation to adapt to changes in the recorded neurons over time. These changes lead to degradation in decoding accuracy and necessitate periodic supervised decoder recalibration. An emerging approach to maintain decoder robustness consists in harnessing the stable relationship that exists between behavior and the latent manifold structure that underlies the activity of populations of neurons. One recent proof of concept (Degenhart et al., 2020) used an approach based on linear manifold discovery (Factor Analysis; FA). It achieved stable closed-loop BCI control over five days without recalibration. However, nonlinear manifold discovery methods produce estimates of manifold structure that are more informative about movement intention on a moment-by-moment basis. Thus, we aimed to develop a platform for nonlinear manifold alignment decoding (NoMAD) to achieve higher performing and stable BCIs.

NoMAD incorporates latent factor analysis via dynamical systems (LFADS), a deep learning approach that uncovers manifold structure by modeling the shared dynamics underlying population activity. NoMAD combines LFADS with unsupervised distribution alignment (Farshchian et al., 2019; Dyer et al., 2017) to produce consistent manifold estimates in the face of changing recorded neurons. We tested NoMAD in an offline analysis of motor cortical activity from a monkey performing an isometric wrist force task throughout 21 sessions spanning more than three months. NoMAD allowed stable, high performance decoding of the monkey’s force over all sessions without supervised recalibration. NoMAD’s force-decoding performance typically ranged from 0.85-0.90 R2, with all sessions exceeding 0.75. In comparison, FA-based stabilization achieved a median of only 0.45 R2, with significant performance fluctuations between sessions. Thus by combining accurate, nonlinear manifold discovery with the stability conferred by manifold alignment, NoMAD enables higher-performing and stable BCIs with greater suitability for real-world application.",Brianna Karpowicz (she/her),"Lahiru Wimalasena, Emory University & Georgia Tech; Mohammad Reza Keshtkaran, Emory University & Georgia Tech; Yahia Ali, Emory University & Georgia Tech; Andrew Sedler, Georgia Tech; Ali Farschian, Northwestern University; Josie Walner, Northwestern University; Xuan Ma, Northwestern University; Ben Semel, Northwestern University; Kevin Bodkin, Northwestern University; Lee Miller, Northwestern University; Chethan Pandarinath, Emory University & Georgia Tech ",Emory University (grid.189967.8),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-27 16:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 16:45:00+00:00,
recq8CQSKncvQnyct,Dynamic analysis of eye-head movements for estimating visuo-cognitive demands during driving,"Driving is a complex activity involving visuo-cognitive processes and failure to meet visual and/or cognitive needs can potentially affect drivers’ safety. Previous studies have shown that eye and head movements contribute to attention reallocation and they are both modulated by visuo-cognitive demands (Doshi et al., 2012; Fang et al., 2015). This study seeks to investigate the effect of visual degradation and increased cognitive demands on drivers’ eye-head movements and their ability to maneuver a vehicle in a driving simulator.
Twenty-one participants (21-34 years old) completed a driving task in which they were asked to maintain their speed constant while doing a concurrent visual task. Every participant performed the experiment with normal vision and with contact lenses inducing a visual degradation. Parameters such as speed and car lateral position were measured in the driving simulator; eye and head movements were recorded through motion capture. Visual exploration was analyzed using spatial and dynamic parameters.
Our results revealed that driving speed, but not car lateral position, was affected by visuo-cognitive demands (p < 0.05). Spatio-temporal parameters typically used to describe visual exploration (i.e. fixation duration, gaze position along horizontal and vertical axes) were not modulated by the visual degradation (all p > 0.05). In contrast, entropy showed that visual scanning was less explorative (p < 0.05) and participants recruited more head movements for horizontal gaze shifts (p = 0.03) when vision was degraded.
In conclusion, we showed that participants’ ability to maneuvering a vehicle while engaged in a secondary task remains relatively intact when vision is not optimal. We also provided evidence that eye-head movements and dynamic visual exploration are sensitive to the quality of vision and could be used as potential indicators of visuo-cognitive demands in more naturalistic tasks, such as driving.",Laura Mikula (she/her),"Sergio Mejía-Romero, Université de Montréal; Romain Chaumillon, Université de Montréal; Amigale Patoine, Université de Montréal; Eduardo Lugo, Université de Montréal; Delphine Bernardin Université de Montréal, Essilor International; Jocelyn Faubert Université de Montréal",York University (grid.21100.32),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-28 12:30:00+00:00,2020-10-28 12:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/VJaZHLnkCvo

Electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected and the Event Related Potential (ERP) N2 measured top-down attentional control resource allocation. The EEG results showed three crucial significant differences: in comparison to low test anxiety (LTA) individuals: (1) in a no threat and low working memory load condition, HTA individuals had larger incongruent N2 amplitudes; (2) in a no threat and high working memory load condition, HTA individuals had larger incongruent and congruent N2 amplitudes; and (3) in a threat and high working memory load condition, HTA individuals had smaller incongruent N2 amplitudes. This significance pattern: (1) clarifies the neural mechanism underlying the frontal lobe’s involvement in the processing of an inhibition task; (2) supports the idea that, in order to maintain (high) task performance, HTA individuals tend to engage in enhanced recruitment of top-down attentional control of inhibition; but also shows that (3) in case of a threat coinciding with a high working memory load, HTA individuals fail to employ this compensatory strategy as they display impoverished top-down attentional control of inhibition.

recqSnrCCyYvjL7IB,EEG Delta Rhythms in Visual Association Cortices Mark Syntactic Constituents,"Recent work has suggested that syntactic processes may be indexed neurologically via amplitude changes in EEG delta oscillations (1-4Hz). However, these observations have been primarily limited to the frequency domain, and little is known of how delta oscillations are modulated in real-time while syntactic processes are performed. In the present study, we used time-frequency analysis to characterize delta responses at constituent boundaries in sentences with a fixed grammatical pattern in contrast to lexically-matched scrambled lists with no obvious syntactic structure. We also sought to identify whether delta activity is modulated by lexico-semantic content. To do this, we included two additional sentence types: Jabberwocky sentences with identical morpho-syntax to grammatical sentence stimuli but where all content words were replaced by nonsense words and a scrambled version of these sentences. Analyses were conducted on the basis of structure (English + Nonsense sentences with grammar vs. English + Nonsense sentences scrambled) and lexico-semantic content (English with Grammar + English scrambled vs. Nonsense with Grammar + Nonsense scrambled). Results of time-frequency analysis revealed no effect of lexico-semantic content; however, higher delta power was observed at constituent boundaries for sentences with grammatical structure relative to word-lists. Post-hoc source analyses identified left-fusiform gyrus as the primary generator of this difference. The fusiform gyrus has been suggested as an interface between the sensory and conceptual systems in order to facilitate efficient visual processing, and as such, it is frequently activated during reading tasks like the one used in the present study. Considering this, we argue that delta oscillations emanating from the fusiform gyrus may reflect the integration of visual information with top-down knowledge of syntactic structure.",M.

recqa5j8e7Q0JBHho,Constrained brain volume in an efficient coding model explains the fraction of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in sensory cortices,"The number of neurons in mammalian cortex varies by multiple orders of magnitude across different species. In contrast, the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons (E:I ratio) varies in a much smaller range, from 3:1 to 9:1 and remains roughly constant for different sensory areas within a species. Despite this structure being important for understanding the function of neural circuits, the reason for this consistency is not yet understood. While recent models of vision based on the efficient coding hypothesis show that increasing the number of both excitatory and inhibitory cells improves stimulus representation, the two cannot increase simultaneously due to constraints on brain volume. In this work, we implement an efficient coding model of vision under a volume (i.e., total number of neurons) constraint while varying the E:I ratio. We show that the performance of the model is optimal at biologically observed E:I ratios under several metrics. We argue that this happens due to trade-offs between the computational accuracy and the representation capacity for natural stimuli. Further, we make experimentally testable predictions that 1) the optimal E:I ratio should be higher for species with a higher sparsity in the neural activity and 2) the character of inhibitory synaptic distributions and firing rates should change depending on E:I ratio. Our findings, which are supported by our new preliminary analyses of publicly available data, provide the first quantitative and testable hypothesis based on optimal coding models for the distribution of neural types in the mammalian sensory cortices.",Arish Alreja,"Ilya Nemenman, Emory University; Christopher Rozell, Georgia Institute of Technology",Carnegie Mellon University (grid.147455.6),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 22:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 22:45:00+00:00,

Dysfunction in self-regulation is a common characteristic of many psychiatric disorders, such as PTSD and ADHD. This study sought to determine whether common neural regions are involved in the regulation of emotion, motor, and memory, and if a data-driven approach using independent components analysis (ICA) would successfully identify intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) that contribute to inhibitory regulation. Eighteen participants underwent neuroimaging while completing an emotion regulation (ER) task, a memory suppression (think/no-think; TNT) task, and a motor inhibition (stop signal; SS) task. In the ER task, participants were presented with negatively valenced pictures and instructed to either feel or inhibit their emotions. In the TNT task, participants received training to remember face-picture (cue-target) pairs. Participants were then presented with only the cue and told to either recall the picture or try to block its retrieval. In the SS task, participants were presented with either a stop- or go-signal and instructed to press a button only at the go-signal – not before the go-signal or at the stop-signal. ICA (CONN; MATLAB) was conducted on the neuroimaging data. Corresponding components were selected across task based on interrelated patterns of activation. Subsequently, ICNs were correlated with behavioral variables. ICA indicated a common medial prefrontal network, striatal network, and frontoparietal executive control network, as well as down-regulation in task-specific ROIs. These results illustrate that overlapping ICNs were exhibited across three distinct inhibitory regulation tasks as successfully identified through a data-driven approach (ICA).",Karisa Hunt (she/her),"Lindsay K.

recqhjGPlfyoAZJM9,Delayed maturation of input plasticity at lateral perforant path synapses onto adult-born dentate granule neurons.,"In the mammalian brain, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus uniquely generates new neurons throughout the lifetime of the animal. Adult-born granule cells undergo a period of maturation during which their membranes are more excitable and inputs from medial perforant path neurons can more easily induce long-term potentiation of synaptic responses. This previously described “critical window” exists between approximately four- and six-weeks of cell age. Whether signaling from the other major cortical input to the dentate gyrus—the lateral perforant path—undergoes the same timecourse of maturation remains unknown. We measured synaptic responses to lateral perforant path stimulation on adult-born granule cells between three- and thirty-weeks old. Surprisingly, we find that long-term potentiation of synaptic responses matures over an extended timecourse, with a peak at around 15-weeks of cell age. Cells between 4- and 6- weeks of age are more likely to experience long-term depression of lateral perforant path inputs than are older cells. We find that facilitation of transmitter release increases over a similar timecourse as long-term potentiation, and that the magnitude of the reduction of facilitation after induction of long-term potentiation predicts the magnitude of that potentiation. These data suggest that an increase in presynaptic release probability at lateral perforant path synapses is the major mechanism of long-term potentiation, and that this plasticity is more prominent at inputs onto older neurons.

recqkPb8XSI9TyUrQ,Behavioral models of visual working memory do not generalize to the whole-report paradigm,"Many prominent behavioral models of visual working memory have been both motivated and validated by results from ""single-report"" change-detection and delayed estimation tasks. Recently, a new ""whole-report"" paradigm was introduced to address shortcomings with these canonical tasks, and to support claims about fundamental properties of visual working memory. However, it is unclear how well results from the relatively complex whole-report paradigm generalize to simpler tasks (and vice versa). Here, we use an existing whole-report dataset to show that participant responses exhibit statistical dependencies between simultaneously-presented stimuli that cannot be accounted for by an entire class of models that assumes independent encoding. We then fit several hierarchical encoding models (proposed to capture dependencies between stimuli) to the data, and find that this model class is also unable to account for whole-report behavior. Finally, we compare response distributions between stimulus types, and find that the dependencies exhibited when reporting hue are not present when reporting orientation, despite very similar overall task performance. Rather than proposing a model to capture behavior across all task paradigms, we suggest that this failure to generalize is the result of model mis-specification. We argue that some visual working memory models would be better conceptualized as models of change-detection or delayed estimation performance, and that more care should be taken when integrating results across stimulus modalities and behavioral paradigms into a single, unified theory.",Ben Cuthbert (he/him),"Dominic Standage, Queen's University, Martin Paré, Queen's University, Gunnar Blohm, Queen's University",Queen's University (grid.410356.5),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 16:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 16:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/jF1R9t9E3pg

However, biophysical single cell models of neurons are typically constrained by in vitro data. These properties are impacted by factors such as cellular morphology, variations in extrinsic inputs received by up to 10K synapses, and the neuromodulatory state. In contrast, in vitro the synaptic inputs (random neurotransmitter release or pre-synaptic AP firing) that affect membrane potential and input resistance are much less pronounced. Thus, our picture of the cell’s in vivo characteristics is incomplete. We attempt to bridge this gap by developing a detailed biophysical model constrained by in vivo data. 
We report the development of a morphologically realistic biophysical model of an L5 pyramidal tract neuron in the rodent primary motor cortex with active channels in the dendrites, including Nat, Ca, SK, Im, Ih, and a dense Ca2+ rich region at the base of the apical tuft. The model is used to conduct parametric studies to probe the effect that synaptic conductances, afferent firing rates, coherence of afferent spike times, and dendritic attenuation have on the baseline firing rate of the neuron. The single cell model will then be inserted into a network model of the motor cortex for investigating computations in motor cortex circuits during a voluntary reaching task.

recqpxbYFVcGqZaM0,Efficient coding in auditory cortex determines target detection behavior,"Sensory systems are composed of neurons with limited dynamic range, but are required to accurately represent a world in which the dynamic range of incoming stimuli can vary wildly. To efficiently encode acoustic environments with different dynamic ranges (referred to here as contrast), neurons in auditory cortex (AC) adapt the gain of their response function to effectively match their dynamic range to that of the environment. However, it is not known whether these widespread changes in neural sensitivity have an impact on auditory percepts. To test this, we trained mice to detect auditory targets in backgrounds of different contrasts, and find that, 1) target detection and sensitivity were improved in low contrast, and, 2) the time-course of target detectability varied depending on contrast, decreasing rapidly after a transition to high contrast, and increasing at a slower rate after a transition to low contrast. These patterns of target detectability are recapitulated in populations of AC neurons simultaneously recorded with behavior and the magnitude of gain modulation in cortical neurons predicts behavioral performance of individual mice. Consistent with these results, a normative model in which neurons efficiently adapt their gain to optimize stimulus reconstruction also exhibits detection performance in line with our behavioral and neural results. Together, these results demonstrate that efficient neural codes in auditory cortex directly influence behavioral percepts.",Chris Angeloni,"Chris Angeloni, University of Pennsylvania; Wiktor Mlynarski, IST Austria; Katherine Wood, University of Pennsylvania; Linda Garami, University of Pennsylvania; Anne Hermundstadt, Janelia HHMI; Maria Geffen, University of Pennsylvania",University of Pennsylvania (grid.25879.31),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-29 17:15:00+00:00,2020-10-29 17:30:00+00:00,
recqqGskZ7IMpCHdI,Molecular pathways of glucocorticoids effects on neurodevelopment,"The brain undergoes rapid growth and maturation during the prenatal period, thus it is highly susceptible to environmental stimuli. During this period increased glucocorticoid exposure of the embryo has been associated with adverse neurobehavioral, e.g. increased attention deficits, and physiological outcomes, e.g. brain structural and functional changes, later in life. Glucocorticoids are one of the main factors mediating stress effects prenatally and one of the main systems found dysregulated in stress-related psychiatric disorders. To investigate these processes in a human specific and reactive system, we used induced Pluripotent Stem Cells-derived 3-dimensional cerebral organoids to model prenatally mediated risk and response to stress and combined them with in vivo mouse models of neurodevelopment. We found a very promising candidate gene for neurodevelopmentally-relevant glucocorticoids response in ZBTB16, which had previously been shown to respond to glucocorticoids in human blood samples.  ZBTB16 is a transcription factor expressed during early development associated with maintenance of the neuronal progenitor pool. ZBTB16 is expressed dynamically throughout human neurodevelopment with high expression in the progenitor cells (PAX6+ cells) early on and downregulation when the first neuronal markers (MAP2, DCX) appear. Chronic dexamethasone exposure (100nM) of organoids for 7 days results in a robust increase of ZBTB16 expression in the progenitor cells. We used in utero electroporations in mice at different developmental time-points and ex vivo electroporations in human cerebral organoids to overexpress ZBTB16, mimicking the effect of glucocorticoids on the transcription factor. Overexpression of ZBTBT16 leads to increased time of proliferation of progenitor cells (PH3+cells) and increased neurogenic divisions of the intermediate progenitor cells (TBR2+ cells). We are working on the molecular signalling pathway of glucocorticoids through ZBTB16 using a ChIP-seq experiment for ZBTB16 in cerebral organoids. We identified ZBTB16 as a mediator of altered neuronal differentiation processes after glucocorticoids stimulation. The molecular mechanisms and pathways we shed light on in this work could have profound implications for our understanding risk to stress exposure during early brain development, and consequently psychopathology vulnerability.",Anthi Krontira,"Anthi C.

However, it is unknown whether low-level visual processing in the occipital cortex supports age-related gains in memory for complex visual stimuli. Here, we examined occipital alpha activity during visual scene encoding in 24 children and adolescents, aged 6.2–20.5 years, who performed a subsequent memory task while undergoing electrocorticographic recording. Scenes were classified as high- or low-complexity by the number of unique object categories depicted. We found that recognition of high-complexity, but not low-complexity, scenes increased with age. Age was associated with decreased alpha power and increased instantaneous alpha frequency during the encoding of subsequently recognized high- compared to low-complexity scenes. Critically, decreased alpha power predicted improved recognition of high-complexity scenes in adolescents. These findings demonstrate how the functional maturation of the occipital cortex supports the development of memory for complex visual scenes.",Qin Yin,"Elizabeth L.

recqt2c1Dvx3pqSMB,Amplified representation of sound termination in the auditory cortex and its behavioral relevance,"Offset responses in auditory processing appear after a sound terminates. In the peripheral auditory system, neuronal circuits within the cochlear and superior paraolivary nuclei play a central role in generating offset responses. In the central auditory system, a recent study showed that neurons in the anterior auditory field (AAF) have significantly stronger responses to sound termination than those in the primary auditory cortex. The mechanisms that generate and drive offset responses within AAF as well as their behavioural relevance remain unknown.
To understand the role of AAF offset responses in sound perception, we asked whether detecting the end of a sound would be influenced by them. Using optogenetics, we showed that preventing AAF offset responses decreases the mouse performance to detect sound termination. 
Next, we combined electrophysiological recordings in auditory cortex and thalamus of awake mice with antidromic stimulation to better understand how cortical offset responses occur. We found that more than 80% of AAF inputs come from onset-offset responsive thalamic cells, indicating that a big portion of information on sound termination in AAF is inherited from the preceding nuclei. However, our results also demonstrate that cortical offset responses are amplified in comparison to the thalamic ones. 
Overall, our results reveal the importance of cortical offset responses in coding and perceiving sound termination. They might play a crucial role for advanced processing such as detecting changes within temporally discontinuous sounds.

recr8G2TIgQT8eNCK,Sensory processing in autism - Translational markers and circuit-level insights ,"Atypical sensory experience is estimated to occur in as many as 90% of autistic individuals and to affect every sensory modality: taste, touch, audition, olfaction and vision. Because the neural computations underlying sensory processing are relatively well understood in typically developing individuals and are relatively conserved between humans and other animals, sensory paradigms have considerable potential for shedding light on autistic neurobiology. But are sensory traits, in fact, core phenotypic markers of autism? In this talk, I will argue that the answer is “yes” [1]. The evidence I review shows that the autistic cortex is affected by distinct, low-level changes in neural circuitry that is dedicated to perceptual processing (including primary sensory areas). Further, perceptual symptoms in individuals with autism are evident early in development, account for independent variance in diagnostic criteria of the condition, and show a persistent relationship to clinical measures of higher-order social cognition and behavior. Finally, I will present data from a recent line of work in my laboratory using behavioral, neuroimaging, pharmacological techniques to identify a marker of autism in low-level visual processing, which has provided concrete insight into the neurobiology of autism in humans [2-4].

The treatment depends on the location and size of the tumour(s). Although both these brain tumour types can easily be detected using multi-modal MRI, to extract them using image segmentation is a challenging task. To perform manual segmentation can take 20 - 60 minutes for a single subject, and automatic brain tumor segmentation can save a lot of time for neuro radiologists.

recro1ueB551iWiUd,A deep generative modelling approach to detect epileptogenic lesions,"Purpose: Focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) may be easily overlooked in conventional visual assessment of MRI. Automated approaches have been proven useful for the detection of FCDs and their use may enhance the postoperative outcome. However, as even most elaborate approaches do not yield satisfactory sensitivity, the development of novel approaches is warranted on clinical grounds. MRI features of FCD type IIb include cortical T2-signal hyperintensities but have sparse correlates in T1-weighted MR-volumes. We here describe an approach leveraging on this apparent difference in MR-modalities and the power of conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) in modality synthesis, by creating a difference image between the real FLAIR and a T1-based synthetic FLAIR mimicking healthy brain structures. We show that the integration of this information in a convolutional neural network (CNN) supports the automatized detection of FCDs.

Methods: We retrospectively collected and manually labelled T1w and FLAIR images of 42 patients (18 females; age=38.8±11.4 y) with an FCD type IIb. T1w images served as input for our cGAN, pre-trained on 80 datasets of healthy controls (37 females; age=44.8±10.6 y), to synthesize artificial FLAIR images. Real and synthetic FLAIR images were in turn subtracted. T1w, FLAIR and the difference images were passed to a multi-scale 3D CNN. Specificity was assessed on a separate cohort of 56 mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients (35 females; age=39.2±11.5).

Results: The cGAN showed robust generation of synthetic FLAIR images on non-lesional brains (SSIM±σ = 0.92±0.04). Employing a five-fold cross-validation scheme, our CNN-classifier reached a sensitivity of 92.9% (39/42 FCDs detected), while maintaining a high specificity of 96.4% (54/56 true negatives).

Conclusion: Our combined deep learning approach using a cGAN for modality synthesis followed by a CNN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

The local and global topology connectivity among functional brain regions directly driven human cognitive behaviors. The real neural signal includes the real neural firing and neural self-noise. Neural self-noise non-regular firing or synchronization will cause severe neuron disease and it also plays a very important role in the functional connectivity. Therefore, how the neural self-noise affect the information flow among brain regions? Firstly, Phase Locking Value(PLV) can investigate task-induced neural synchronization from the EEG signal [1]. Secondly, Shannon’s information theory and its extensions framework can be used to quantitative the maximum information capacity in the noise neural channel. The basic idea is 1) simulation: the fake neural signal (EEG) produced by setting certain time points, number of subjects, and number trials with neural self-noise. The amplitude of neural signals can be changed according to given parameters. 2) Phase Locking Value (PLV) measured among brain regions with setting different parameters of time series. 3) redundancy measured among brain regions with Total Correlation (TC)/Multivariate Mutual Information. [2] 4) Compared different measure results and check how the neural self-noise affects the information flow in the brain. The result shown 1) neural-self noise directly affect functional connectivity among brain regions (increase neuron self-noise will reduce PLV and TC) 2) TC has stronger statistical power than PLV in the quantitative functional connectivity

However, the fundamental computational and neural mechanisms that might support this phenomenon remain unknown. In this study, we sought to identify neural mechanisms supporting task state reactivation as a potential mechanism that might underlie these symptoms. Subjects completed an task that involved navigating through a maze of unique task states during MEG scanning. Critically, some states were probabilistically associated with electric shock, and subjects were required to use their knowledge of the task state space to successfully avoid shock. Behaviourally, subjects used model-based inference to successfully avoid shock, and at a neural level this was linked to reactivation of subsequently chosen goal states during planning. Following outcome receipt, we observed reactivation of the unchosen goal state, potentially facilitating counterfactual updating.

recrrVSYizj5cAvsN,Is motherhood a moderator of empathy for pain? An fMRI study,"Social competencies such as empathy and understanding others’ minds are vital for parents towards successful parenting. They not only allow adequate reactions to a child’s needs but since parents are important role models, they are also passed on to the children (Kluczniok et al. 2016). To date, little is known about the modulating effect of motherhood on social understanding and specifically on the understanding of a child’s mind versus an adult’s mind. In this study, we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to investigate empathy for pain in mothers and women without children. Our task used both adult and children as protagonists in the stimulus material. Women were recruited that were either i) mothers of one child between 4 and 10 years old (corresponding to the age of the children in the stimulus material), or ii) had no children and also did not interact with them on a regular basis. Univariate analyses of our neuroimaging data show significant differences between the conditions empathy with a child versus empathy with an adult in the left SMG. Additionally, mothers and women without children show significantly different activation patterns with stronger activation in the bilateral anterior insula when asked to imagine people in painful scenarios while viewing pictures showing these scenarios. This hints at differences in strategies in reacting to people in painful situations with mothers recruiting more strongly those areas traditionally related to empathy. Successful classification based on both motherhood and protagonist of the stimuli strengthens these findings.

recrrmDPI7xdM3BGZ,Neural Signature of Subjective Confidence in Perceptual Decision Making,"Drift diffusion models propose that decisions are formed by continuously accumulating sensory information. Once the accumulated evidence reaches a boundary, a decision is made. Stronger evidence is accumulated faster and reaches the decision boundary quicker. According to some proposals, confidence in the accuracy of a decision depends on the same accumulated evidence underlying the choice. The central parietal positivity (CPP) component of the human event-related potential (ERP) has been demonstrated to encode accumulated evidence for a decision, like the ramping activity found in the parietal cortex of monkeys during evidence accumulation. As the buildup rate of the CPP indicates how quickly evidence is accumulated, it would be reasonable to expect that the CPP indexes confidence. In this study, we examined how evidence strength influences subjective reports of confidence in observers’ perceptual decisions and how the CPP changes with different levels of evidence strength and confidence. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were measured while participants (n=25) performed a two-alternative dot-motion discrimination task with six motion coherence levels. Consistent with previous research, we found that the buildup rate of the CPP increased with stronger evidence and faster responses, indicating the build-to-bound dynamic of a decision variable. More interestingly, the buildup rate scaled with the confidence rating on the decision, suggesting that evidence accumulation in the brain (i.e. CPP) is tightly linked to the subjective perceptual experience of the sensory information favoring the decision. Further analysis showed that the response-aligned CPP ramped up faster for higher confidence when holding motion coherence constant. We conclude that, independent of the influence of objective evidence strength, 
CPP reflects subjective confidence.

But despite the large trial-to-trial variability of neural activity, humans show a remarkable adaptability to unexpected adverse events during goal-directed behavior. The origin of this cognitive ability, described as constitutive of general intelligence, is still disputed. In this talk, I will show that implementing computation noise in recurrent neural networks boosts their cognitive resilience to a variety of adverse events entirely unseen during training, in a way that strikingly resembles human cognition in similar conditions. In contrast to neural networks featuring exact computations, noisy networks and humans acquire behavioral hallmarks of Bayesian inference in a ‘zero-shot’ fashion – without prior experience with conditions that require these computations for maximizing rewards. These findings suggest that human intelligence may ride on computation noise to promote near-optimal behavior in adverse conditions without any engineered cognitive sophistication.",Valentin Wyart,"Charles Findling, École Normale Supérieure",École Normale Supérieure (grid.5607.4),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 09:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 09:30:00+00:00,

In   particular,   recent   studies   indicate   that   range   adaptation,   i.e.,the mechanism by which neurons dynamically tune their output firing properties to match the changing statistics of their inputs, may drive plastic changes in the brain’s decision system that induce systematic deviations  to  rationality.  Here,  we  ask  whether  behaviorally-relevant  neural  information  processing may  be  distorted  by  other incidental, hard-wired,biological  constraints,  in  particular:  Hebbian plasticity. One of our main contributionsis to propose a simple computational method for identifying (and comparing) the neural signature of such biological mechanisms or constraints. Using ANNs (i.e., artificial neural network models) and RSA (i.e.,representational similarity analysis), we compare the neural  signatures  of  two  types  of  hard-wired  biological  mechanisms/constraints:  namely,  range adaptation  and Hebbian  plasticity.

recsCwcHeQHTnYrrK,Role of Path Information in Visual Perception of Joint Stiffness ,"Humans have an astonishing ability to extract hidden information from the movement of others. In previous work, subjects observed the motion of a simulated stick-figure, two-link planar arm and estimated its stiffness. Fundamentally, stiffness is the relation between force and displacement. Given that subjects were unable to physically interact with the simulated arm, they were forced to make their estimates solely based on observed kinematic information. Remarkably, subjects were able to correctly correlate their stiffness estimates with changes in the simulated stiffness, despite lack of force information. We posit that subjects were only able to do this because the controller used to produce the simulated arm’s movement, composed of oscillatory motions driving mechanical impedances, resembled the controller humans use to produce their own movement. However, it is still unknown how this controller is encoded in the nervous system, and consequently, what motion features subjects used to determine their stiffness rating. Human motion exhibits systematic velocity-curvature patterns, and these patterns play an important role in perceiving and interpreting motion. Thus, we hypothesized that manipulating the velocity profile should affect subjects’ ability to estimate stiffness. To test this, we changed the velocity profile of the simulated two-link planar arm while keeping the simulated endpoint paths the same. Even with manipulated velocity signals, subjects were still able to estimate changes in simulated joint stiffness with the same level of accuracy observed in the original experiment. These results suggest that path information predominates over temporal information when humans use visual observation to estimate stiffness.",Aaron West (he/him/his),"Aaron Michael West Jr., Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Meghan Huber, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Massachusetts Amherst; Neville Hogan, Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (grid.116068.8),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 17:15:00+00:00,2020-10-30 17:30:00+00:00,
recsQL64jCs5K5aDt,Biomimetic stimulation improves accuracy of vestibular prosthesis-evoked vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) responses,"The vestibular system is crucial for maintaining visual stability via the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).  Accordingly, patients with bilateral vestibulopathy suffer debilitating oscillopsia and dizziness. To improve patients’ quality of life, one emerging approach is a prosthesis that senses head rotation and transforms the movement into vestibular afferent stimulation, substituting for the damaged periphery. Though such devices can partially restore VOR function, current approaches do not represent the specific high-pass dynamics by which actual vestibular afferents encode head motion. We hypothesized that a more biomimetic design would improve performance. To test this, we incorporated afferent-like dynamics into our vestibular prosthesis. Two rhesus monkeys with bilateral vestibular hypofunction were implanted with unilateral prosthesis (targeting horizontal canal afferents). At 7 rotation frequencies (0.2 – 20 Hz), we recorded the VOR eye movements evoked by 5 different mappings: 1) no dynamics (constant gain and no phase lead), 2) regular afferent-like dynamics, 3) irregular afferent-like dynamics, 4) the combination of the two, and 5) very high-pass irregular dynamics. The gain and phase of the evoked VOR response were then analyzed. All 4 afferent-like mappings yielded constant gains up to ~5 Hz while the gains remained constant only up to 1 Hz without the afferent-like dynamics. The phase of the 4 biomimetic mappings was more compensatory (temporally precise) across a range of frequencies. In contrast, the mapping without dynamics did not maintain accurate timing and showed increasing phase lag as a function of frequency, consistent with an uncompensated fixed delay. Overall, our results show that a mapping that mimics regular afferents best maintains the VOR gain and compensatory phase response across frequencies. Further, our results have a direct clinical significance, providing support for a more biomimetic approach to improve prosthesis performance and, in turn, functional outcomes of patients with bilateral vestibulopathy.",Kantapon Pum Wiboonsaksakul (he/him),"Dale C Roberts, Johns Hopkins University; Charles C Della Santina, Johns Hopkins University; Kathleen E Cullen, Johns Hopkins University",Johns Hopkins University (grid.21107.35),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 21:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 21:45:00+00:00,

Accumulated researches provided evidences that, early parent-child separation leads to the deficits in cognitive processes, education, emotion and health. However, the neural level of deficits of social cognition, which induced by parent-child separation in rural China is unclear. To evaluate these, we compared brain activation (the social interaction difference) and behavioral differences between 81 non /partially /completely left-behind children ages of 52-76 months (mean = 64.98 ± 6.321 months) in two joint attention tasks, i.e., IJA: initiating joint attention and RJA: response to joint attention, which was implemented with different interactive objects (teacher and stranger). Results demonstrated that higher prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation during joint attention tasks, higher activation in responding to stranger than teacher, especially in IJA, and the activation of joint attention positively associated with language score, cognitive flexibility and facial expression recognition. More importantly, partially-left-behind children evoked a higher brain activation in IJA tasks and presented a higher language level than completely/non-left-behind children.

recsaAqj6Zbwxia3h,Trajectory Prediction in a Biologically Inspired Network with a Strong Inductive Bias,"Animals are able to track objects through a visual space and make predictions about future locations after relatively few observations, even when the dynamics governing the trajectory are relatively novel. In contrast, machine learning techniques typically generalize poorly when presented with dynamics which don't match the training data. Here we introduce a model architecture which attempts to bridge this gap, by incorporating principles of hierarchical predictive coding. 

The essential component of this model is a predictive module which takes in two sequential observations, and outputs a prediction of the next observation of that same state space. Internally, each module has four layers: two inputs, a transformation layer that computes the difference between subsequent observations, and a prediction layer which takes in the more recent observation and the transition layer. These modules can operate on observations either directly from the target space, or the internal state from another predictive module. When training a network out of these modules, learning is on a per-module level based on its predicted value compared to the next observed input. 

We tested generalization of the model by using two test datasets, and comparing to a standard LSTM. In-domain generalization was tested with datasets which matched the dynamics of the training set, but with unseen initial conditions. Out of domain generalization was tested using PDEs of the same order and dimensionality, but different parameterizations, as the training set. 

We found that the models perform approximately the same for in-domain generalization with teacher forcing. For out of domain data, the predictive module network accumulates error at approximately half the rate as the LSTM model. 

These results demonstrate how an appropriately structured network utilizing a single local loss-function can perform similarly to globally optimized models, while generalizing better.

recsd9La77zbx98uQ,"Language networks reorganization in neurodegenerative disorders: behavioral, structural, and functional evidence from semantic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia.","Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which patients progressively lose speech and language abilities due to neurodegeneration of left-hemisphere language networks. Three variants are recognized, associated respectively with phonology and/or short-term verbal memory deficits (logopenic variant), grammar and/or speech-motor deficits (nonfluent variant), or semantic deficits (semantic variant, or svPPA). svPPA patients manifest a deep, generalized, loss of semantic knowledge and relatively focal anterior temporal (ATL) lobe atrophy. 
Here, we capitalize on this unique clinical model and MEG recordings to investigate the spatiotemporal features of language networks and in particular the crucial role of the ATL in semantic processing. 
First, we show that svPPA patients over-rely on dorsal, occipito-parietal brain regions during irregular word reading. This evidence corroborates a dual-route model where reading aloud is mediated by the interplay between a ventral lexico-semantic system and a dorsal sub-lexical/phonological one.
Second, we find that, during a semantic categorization task, svPPA patients show greater activation over bilateral occipital cortices and superior temporal gyrus, as well as inconsistent engagement of frontal regions. These findings indicate a pervasive reorganization of brain networks in response to ATL neurodegeneration: defective semantic representations are compensated via enhanced perceptual processing (in occipital regions) and semantic control (in the fronto-parietal network).
Finally, we demonstrate that the error patterns in an auditory verb generation task depend on the breakdown of different neurocognitive mechanisms across PPA variants. Specifically, svPPA patients produce the highest percentage of unrelated-verb responses and the highest number of light verbs, providing additional evidence of the critical role played by the ATL in semantic processing.

Although they are overlapping seperate functions, recent neuroimaging studies present a wide literature on mutual or adjacent brain areas host these feaures. In this study, we aimed to show whether inhibition processes are shared on PFC during event related emotional and color-word Stroop tasks. We collected fNIRS data from prefrontal regions of 5 healthy young people without any neuropsychiatric conditions. Emotional Stroop task presented via happy and sad faces with congruent and incongruent words in the middle of the picture.

However, recent experiments have shown that neural population codes in many brain areas continuously change even when the animals have learned and stably perform their tasks. This representational ``drift'' naturally leads to questions about its causes, dynamics and functions. To address these questions, we consider a basic and biologically-plausible model of representation learning, the Hebbian/anti-Hebbian network, and hypothesize that drifting representation is due to noisy synaptic updates and turnover. We find that while the receptive fields of individual neurons change significantly over time, representational similarity of population codes is stable over time, providing a substrate for robust downstream readout by a Hebbian neuron. We investigate the dynamics of the drift, and find that the drift speed can be quantified by a rotational diffusion constant, which is determined by the learning rate, noise level and upstream input statistics.

Despite recent advances in our understanding of the cells and circuits implicated in the processing of itch information, chronic itch often presents itself without an apparent cause. Here, we identify a spinal subpopulation of inhibitory neurons defined by the expression of Ptf1a, involved in gating mechanosensory information self-generated during movement. These neurons receive tactile and motor input and establish presynaptic inhibitory contacts on mechanosensory afferents. Loss of Ptf1a neurons leads to increased hairy skin sensitivity and chronic itch, partially mediated by the classic itch pathway involving gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) spinal neurons. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of GRPR neurons elicits itch which is suppressed by concomitant activation of Ptf1a neurons.

recst0oBMYgugukcz,"A novel, high-throughput monitoring system for maternal behavior in mice","Understanding the neural circuitry of maternal behavior requires a comprehensive
functional analysis of the repertoire an animal has developed in an ecologically valid setting to ensure its survival. To achieve this, we designed an ethological automated habitat for mice, where behavioral data can be collected for months at a time and that supports gain/loss-of- function interventions and neural recordings. Our naturalistic enclosure is soundproofed and temperature and humidity-controlled to simulate the conditions of a mouse burrow in the wild.

Previously, our lab found that the neuropeptide oxytocin could promote long-term plasticity and mediate experience-dependent changes in neural circuits that serve to increase the sensitivity to pup cues, thereby facilitating behavioral responses to pup distress. These behavioral responses to pup social signals continues throughout life, possibly benefitting future offspring. Central and peripheral release of oxytocin during pregnancy and perinatally has been shown to support the onset of maternal behavior and facilitate attachment, bonding, and breastfeeding, both by increasing the salience of social cues and by interacting with reward systems that reinforce mother-infant interactions

As proof of concept, we used this comprehensive behavioral phenotyping tool to investigate mother-pup interactions in the nest across consecutive litters. To elucidate the effects of oxytocinergic variability in maternal bonding, we monitored four wild-type female mice across pregnancies (two of them from mating to their third pregnancy), as well as two oxytocin receptor knockout females over mating and first pregnancy. We found that primiparous dams spend less time in the nest as these same animals then do in later pregnancies. We also found that perinatal nest quality is a robust predictor of the survival of the litter; the lower the nest integrity, the higher the likelihood the litter won’t survive. Interestingly, wild-type dams who neglect or cannibalize their pups show similar nest-building patterns and time spent in the nest as oxytocin receptor knockout mice who tend to have notoriously high pup mortality.

recsw9uzn7JeRgwgM,The influence of target reward on motor planning and online motor decision,"The central nervous system uses sophisticated strategies to plan and execute upper limb reaching movements. Motor planning involves the selection of a goal amongst multiple options that is biased by factors such as the biomechanical cost or the expected gains of the potential movements. Likewise, motor execution is influenced by parameters such as reward, which invigorates reaching movements in a way that is coherent with robust optimal feedback control models. To date, the effect of costs and rewards on planning and control has been studied separately, and it remains unknown whether and how target selection may be influenced by reward following disturbances during ongoing actions. To address this question, we designed an experiment in which we sought to determine whether the distribution of rewards amongst three potential options (either all targets had the same reward or the lateral targets had smaller reward) had an influence on motor planning and execution in presence of unexpected mechanical perturbations. We observed a decrease of the online change in target goal when the lateral targets had smaller rewards, for all mechanical perturbation levels. Interestingly we observed, when all the targets had the same reward, a negative correlation between the EMG activity of muscles and the propensity to switch target online: higher activity correlated with smaller change propensity. In order to confirm this effect, we designed a similar second experiment in which a leftward background load was applied through some trials to pre-excite the muscles. Remarkably, we observed that the application of the leftward background load decreased the frequency of switch toward the leftward target at all perturbation levels. In all, our study revealed that multiple mechanisms underlie reward-dependent planning and control of movement: a robust control strategy that leverages gain-scaling and a more flexible control strategy that enables rapid and online target changes.

Previous studies have identified deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the perforant pathway to dentate gyrus synapses as a robust consequence of PAE. This study sought to investigate how PAE effects LTP in the dentate gyrus and how PAE influences continuous EEG signaling and time-frequency relationships in evoked responses after high-frequency stimulation (HFS). We utilized a rat model of moderate PAE (60 mg/dl peak blood alcohol content). Thirteen urethane-anesthetized adult male rats were implanted with monopolar electrodes in the dorsal dentate gyrus and in the entorhinal cortical perforant pathway. Evoked responses were recorded (1/30s) at 20KHz and continuous data were obtained at 1KHz throughout sessions. Synaptic potentiation was induced by 5 trains of HFS over 25ms with 30s inter-train intervals. PAE rats displayed reduced LTP of the fEPSP (p = 0.01). Data were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation (FFT) within the delta to gamma frequency bands, as well individual frequencies ranging from 1-16 Hz, including slow oscillatory activity (<1Hz) and rhythmic slow activity (3-15Hz). At baseline, the PAE group displayed a trend toward increased delta power (p = 0.055) and significantly increased 2-3Hz power (p = 0.042). There were no group differences following HFS or in relative power for any phase. Time frequency analyses performed on individual evoked responses revealed a greater increase in power associated with the fEPSP in SAC rats, whereas PAE displayed increased power in later portions of the evoked response that reflect feedback signaling from local interneurons. These observations suggest that deficits in LTP following PAE may be related to alterations in local inhibitory interneuron activity and rhythmic activity in the dentate gyrus.",Monica Goncalves-Garcia,"Savage DD, Department of Neurosciences - University of New Mexico; Hamilton DA, Department of Psychology - University of New Mexico",University of New Mexico (grid.266832.b),"Theme B: Neural Excitability, Synapses, and Glia",Traditional talk,2020-10-26 18:30:00+00:00,2020-10-26 18:45:00+00:00,
recsyLtfz2nVe0E58,Selective impacts of sleep deprivation on brain and behavior,"Sleep is essential to brain functioning and lack of sleep greatly impairs behavior, yet the mechanisms underlying the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation remain largely unclear. Here we investigate how sleep deprivation influences the structure of neural connections and the function of neural communications that, in turn, lead to the behavioral impairments. 

Using a combination of quantitative structural MRI, multi-compartment diffusion MRI, resting-state functional MRI, task functional MRI, behavioral testing and physiological monitoring, we traced the changes in brain structural indices (axon density, axon diameter, myelination), functional indices (signal propagation speed, signal-to-noise ratio, coding accuracy), behavioral indices (perception, decision making, introspection, attention, vigilance, action, emotion) and physiological indices (pupillary light reflex, resting heart rate, resting breathing pattern), across 36 hours of sleep deprivation and one night of recovery sleep, in 14 healthy young adults. 

Analysis of behavioral data revealed that the time course of performance detriment is largely dissociable between behavioral domains. The detriment was first observed in vigilance and mood ratings, followed by perceptual decision making and introspection. By contrast, visual spatial attention and perception remain relatively unaffected by sleep deprivation. The heterogeneous changes in behavioral performances hint towards a stronger impact of sleep deprivation on prefrontal cortex than on parietal-occipital cortex, which we are currently testing via analysis of brain structural and functional data.

rect4fc1azu0nCBs6,Task-specificity and neural adaptations after balance learning in healthy young adults,"Introduction: Only 30 minutes of balance skill training lead to significant improvements in behavioral and neuromuscular outcome measures. However, it is unclear if such a rapidly acquired skill is also retained and transferred to other untrained balance tasks. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a single balance training on balance skill acquisition, retention, and transferability and to examine the underlying neural plasticity by intermuscular coherence and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
Methods: Healthy young adults (n=36, age 20.9, 18M) were randomly assigned to learn balancing on a wobble board (BAL), cycle while seated (CYC) or sit and rest (CON) for 20 minutes. Before, immediately and ~7 days after the exercise session, we assessed performance of the trained and several untrained balance tasks. Potential underlying neural mechanisms were examined by intermuscular coherence of lower extremity muscles and by TMS. 
Results: BAL improved balance performance in the trained task by 338.9% (±257.2, effect size [d]=1.94), while CT (21.5% ±70.3, d=0.07) and NC (25.8% ± 85.3, d=0.05) did not. BAL retained the acquired skill after a 1-week-long off-line, no-training period (256.0% ±165.5). No changes occurred in 12 measures of untrained balance outcomes, 8 measures of intermuscular coherence, and in 4 TMS measures of supra-spinal plasticity (all p>0.05).
Conclusions: A single unstable balance-board training session but not cycling or rest improved the trained balance skill by margins observed in long term studies without transfer to other balancing skills or changes in neural plasticity. Future studies will examine in more detail and by additional methods the neuromechanical mechanisms and the time course underlying the remarkable level of specificity of learning a balance skill.

rect4r9YIhZj6vYSF,Cellular mechanisms of consciousness and dreaming,"Recent breakthroughs in neurobiology indicate that the time is ripe to understand how cellular-level mechanisms are related to conscious experience. We  propose that consciousness depends on the integration between two different parts of the cortical pyramidal neuron. In conscious states, these parts are coupled, thus enabling complex signal propagation and sustained dynamics within the thalamocortical system.  When these parts of the pyramidal cell are functionally torn apart, such signal propagation is prohibited and consciousness breaks down. Hence, differences in global dynamics of large scale networks between conscious and unconscious states are controlled by local gates within pyramidal cells.

We further suggest that the hallmark of conscious processing is the flexible integration of bottom-up and top-down data streams enabled through dendritic integration on a cellular level. This cellular integration mechanism provides the foundation for Dendritic Information Theory (DIT). DIT offers a natural explanation for why conscious experience is modulated by context and prior knowledge.

We then explain how this mechanism can shed light on the neural mechanisms dreaming. We posit that during dreams neurons are in a state where they are driven top-down by the generative model. High acetylcholine and low noradrenaline put the pyramidal cells in a specific mode, where they are driven internally and activated through their apical dendrites. This could also be the neural mechanism for imagery and hallucinations.

Taken together, we propose a theory of how top-down and bottom-up information streams are combined on the cellular level. We think that besides illuminating the neural basis of consciousness and dreaming these ideas are relevant for figuring out the neural implementation of predictive processing and for developing novel AI algorithms.

Our research concentrates on the use of brain biometrics, machine learning methods, and pure mathematics to improve the current answers to the Brain Age Problem (BAP). In this work, we derived the Normalized Stretching Ratio (NSR) given by (Thickness)^2/(Surface Area), which is a surrogate of the isoperimetric ratio that quantifies the stretching of a brain region. We used the NSRs of 68 brain regions as the predictors of a classification model on a freely available data set of young adults, collected by the Human Connectome Project. Our model does not sacrifice prediction accuracy when compared to a similar model on the raw data and so the dimensionality reduction provided by the NSRs yields a simpler explanation of the changes that occur in the brain. Our model reduces the gap between explainability and prediction accuracy by merging ideas from pure mathematical fields, such as differential geometry, machine learning, and neuroscience.

rectHg0E3g7PiKtUt,Temporal regularity is an essential social cue in mouse vocal communication,"Animals navigating the real world continuously face large amounts of complex sensory information. One of the strategies used by the brain to perceptually compress multidimensional input is to selectively extract the features relevant for behaviour and survival. Like humans and many other mammals, mice communicate using acoustically complex vocal sequences. However, little is known about what acoustic information listeners monitor and use from these sensory streams during social interactions. 
Here, we utilized female mice’s natural behavioural response to male courtships songs to identify the relevant acoustic dimensions used by listeners in their social decisions. Using playbacks of intact and acoustically manipulated songs in an ethologically-relevant assay, we evaluated the behavioural relevance of several candidate acoustic features in mouse communication.
We found that female listeners were highly sensitive to disruptions of song temporal regularity and preferentially approached playbacks of intact male songs over rhythmically irregular versions of the songs. In contrast, female behaviour was invariant to manipulations affecting the global structure of the song, such as randomized sequential organization and song temporal reversal. Similarly, manipulating the local spectro-temporal structure of individual syllables, such as phase-scrambling or pure tone approximation, did not influence female behaviour to male song playback.
Our findings highlight temporal regularity in vocal sequences as a key acoustic cue extracted by listeners during natural vocal-directed behaviour. By identifying which acoustic dimensions in vocal sequences are behaviourally-relevant, respectively less informative, to listeners, this work frames ongoing electrophysiological investigations into the neuronal substrates supporting the perception of vocal sequences.

rectItFnujw5LBz0l,Atypical Development of Working Memory of Biological Motion in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Its Relation to Core Autistic Symptoms,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder whose core symptoms include impaired social interaction and interpersonal communication. Elucidating their developmental trajectory of social information processing is important for advancing theories of etiology and intervention of ASD. While previous research has charted the development of joint attention and theory of mind, the development of perception of biological motion (BM) among children with ASD is still understudied. By viewing point-light displays of human movements, typically-developed (TD) people is capable of inferring others’ identity, gender or emotion with ease. Our recent study has found that working memory of BM (WM-BM) develops rapidly around age 4 and 5 among TD children. Here we examine whether children with ASD has similar critical development of BM. We tested WM-BM as well as that of inverted biological motion (WM-IBM) among children with and without ASD aged between 4 and 6 yrs. For TD children, both WM-BM and WM-IBM capacity increased steadily between age 4 and 6. Children with ASD had similar performance as TD children at age 4 and 5 but lagged behind at age 6. For them, only WM-IBM but not WM-BM capacity increased with age, highlighting a specific slow-down in development of social information processing. Importantly, we found that the WM-BM capacity correlated with the severity of core symptoms of autism among children with ASD, suggesting that our working memory test based on BM is a good indicator of social development in this population. Since the preference for BM stimuli is reduced among high-risk autism infants as early as 8-month old, our results suggest that early deviation in preference and perception of social stimuli would lead to impaired high-level cognition (i.e., WM here) of related stimuli years later, a developmental path that might be shared by various social-cognitive abilities among individuals with ASD.",Linlin Gong,"Linlin Gong, School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China; Yiyang Cai, School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China; Dong Guo,  Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, Zhejiang University, Xixi Campus, Hang Zhou, China; Yajie Liu, School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China;Shaolin Zeng, Zaifeng Gao,  Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, Zhejiang University, Xixi Campus, Hang Zhou, China;Kunlin Wei, School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China",Peking University (grid.11135.37),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Interactive talk,2020-10-30 02:00:00+00:00,2020-10-30 02:15:00+00:00,

rectMdBHIF0ZgaQAN,Pre-training RNNs on ecologically relevant tasks explains rats suboptimal behavior in a simple categorization task ,"In order to make optimal decisions in real-world environments it is fundamental to take into account recent stimuli and the actions made in response to them, together with the outcomes of those actions. A recent study (Hermoso-Mendizabal et al.) has shown that rats are able to leverage the information contained in the trial history of a perceptual two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task that includes serial correlations in the trial sequence. However, rats only used this trial history information after correct trials and failed to do so after error trials, when they temporarily followed a strategy only based on the current stimulus. Here we use RNNs to investigate whether this reset strategy reflects an adaptive mechanism or alternatively reveals fundamental limits in the capacity of simple neural circuits to perform counterfactual inference.     
We trained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in the same 2AFC task used for rats and found that the networks, like the rats, learned to leverage the sequence partial predictability  to increase their categorization accuracy after correct trials. However, RNNS also used this predictability after error trials departing from the reset strategy of the rats and resembling the behavior of an optimal agent that can perform counterfactual inference. 
We hypothesize that the discrepancy between the rats and RNNs behavior is due to the fact that networks are fully optimizing their performance in the 2AFC task whereas the brain of rats has been shaped by evolution in order to optimize their performance in more ecological environments. As a consequence, although rats manage to perform well in the task, they are not able to fully adapt their behavior to it. We show that by pre-training the RNNs in the same task but using a number of choices larger than two, they exhibit  the reset strategy displayed by the rats, which is close to an optimal behavior in a more complex environment with multiple options.
Our results suggest that seemingly sub-optimal behaviors in laboratory tasks (e.g. the reset strategy) can be a byproduct of the adaptation to more complex environments. Furthermore, our work demonstrates the usefulness of pre-training artificial neural networks in ecologically plausible environments before testing them on the task of interest.

rectPdDkEi3kT8J2o,Area-specific and frequency-dependent relationship between local field potentials and neural population dynamics,"Local field potentials (LFPs) are generated by the summed synaptic input currents to local neurons. Many studies have shown that the activity of populations of cortical neurons is well described by low-dimensional, population-wide “latent dynamics”. Here we provide the first investigation of how much information is shared between these latent dynamics and the LFPs that ostensibly drive them. 

We used microelectrode arrays to record LFPs and single neuron activity from premotor, primary motor and primary somatosensory cortex as monkeys performed an instructed delay reaching task. We calculated the latent dynamics from the single unit activity using principal component analysis. We computed the LFP power in eight standard frequency bands as well as the “local motor potential”, the moving average of the broadband LFP.

We first examined the relationship between each LFP band and the latent dynamics separately for each cortical area using canonical correlation analysis, a method that quantifies the correlation between the dynamics of two sets of signals. Although for all three areas the lowest and highest LFP frequency bands were strongly correlated with the latent dynamics, the LFP-to-latent dynamics correlations at mid-frequencies were quite variable across areas. 

We obtained these results by focusing on one particular aspect of the behaviour: movement preparation for premotor cortex, and movement execution for primary motor and sensory cortices. We asked whether the area-specific relationships were preserved across these different aspects of the behaviour. We computed the canonical correlations between LFP and latent dynamics for both behavioural epochs, then compared the two sets of correlations. Remarkably, for both areas, these correlations were the same during movement planning and execution, and greatly exceeded the correlations observed when monkeys were not engaged in the task. Adopting a neural population view thus allows stable area-specific and frequency-dependent relationships between neural activity and LFPs to be identified. ",Cecilia Gallego Carracedo,"Matthew G.

In this work, we aim to clarify the extent to which potentially multiple regions of lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) encode information about the locations of body parts. To this end we applied voxel-wise modeling to BOLD responses for five participants across three diverse naturalistic stimulus sets: static natural images, natural movie clips, and computer-rendered scenes. From each stimulus set we used a deep neural network (OpenPose) to extract the locations and identities of different body parts. We then applied regularized linear regression to these features to estimate the relationship between each body feature and the BOLD responses of individual voxels. We validated our regression model by calculating prediction accuracies at each voxel. In addition to FFA, OFA, and pSTS, our model accurately predicted BOLD responses in voxels surrounding hMT, confirming body part selectivity in these regions. Variance partitioning incorporating motion energy features and binary ‘building present’ and ‘human present’ labels revealed unique variance explained by our body model in these regions, suggesting our prediction performance in these voxels is not merely due to naturalistic stimulus confounds. Finally, we contrasted voxel-wise model weights corresponding to different body features to measure differences in tuning based on body part identity and visual field location. This analysis revealed patchy selectivity for hands compared to faces around hMT and selectivity for the contralateral visual field throughout LOTC, particularly near the Lateral Occipital Sulcus. These results argue for an anatomically-circumscribed model of body-selectivity in LOTC and lend support to previous reports positing the existence of multiple sub-regions of EBA.",Matthew Shinkle,"Matthew W.

rectZT1zqZXWsRgZs,The response to background motion: characteristics of a hand stabilization mechanism,"When making goal-directed movements towards a target, our hand deviates from its path in the direction of sudden background motion. We introduce the Hand Stabilization Hypothesis to explain this ‘manual following response’. This hypothesis suggests that any abrupt background motion near the desired endpoint of one’s action is attributed to that point having moved relative to oneself. This leads to the hand following any motion within that relevant region to stabilize the ongoing movement. In six experiments, we accumulate evidence in support of this hypothesis. Participants were asked to intercept a moving target when it reached a certain area and, at a fixed moment during the hand’s interceptive action, background structures started to move either leftward or rightward. We determined the response of the hand by subtracting its velocity when the background moved leftward from its velocity when the background moved rightward. The participants’ hand responded to background motion even if the majority of background structures remained static or if background structures were only briefly visible. Thus, the response cannot be driven by judgments of self-motion based on the instantaneous optic flow within the relevant part of the background. The response was most sensitive to motion close to where the target was to be hit, both in the visual field and in depth. Even motion of only three small dots in that area was sufficient to elicit a response. Together these experiments characterise the fast and simple hand stabilization mechanism that is likely to be relevant for the control of an ongoing hand movement in a dynamic environment.",Emily Crowe,"Emily M.

However, the sheer volume of data and its dynamical complexity are critical barriers to uncovering and interpreting these dynamics. Deep learning methods are a particularly promising approach due to their ability to uncover meaningful relationships from large, complex, and noisy datasets. One such method, latent factor analysis via dynamical systems (LFADS), uses recurrent neural networks to infer latent dynamics from high-D neural spiking data. When applied to motor cortical (M1) activity during stereotyped behaviors, LFADS substantially improved the ability to uncover dynamics and their relation to subjects’ behaviors on a moment-by-moment, millisecond timescale. However, applying LFADS to less-structured behaviors, or in brain areas that are not predominantly driven by intrinsic dynamics, is far more challenging. This is because LFADS, like many deep learning methods, requires careful hand-tuning of complex model hyperparameters (HPs) to achieve good performance. Here we demonstrate AutoLFADS, a large-scale, automated model tuning framework that can characterize dynamics in diverse brain areas without regard to behavior. AutoLFADS uses distributed computing to train dozens of models simultaneously while using evolutionary algorithms to optimally tune HPs in a completely unsupervised way. AutoLFADS required 10-fold less data to uncover dynamics from macaque M1/PMd, with better generalization to unseen behavioral conditions than previous LFADS models. We then tested data from the somatosensory and dorsomedial frontal cortices, areas with very different dynamics from M1/PMd.

rectnwubytjyBdCRI,Preferential subspace identification (PSID) for modeling behaviorally relevant neural dynamics,"In addition to any specific behavior of interest, neural activity often relates to other brain functions as well as brain states with distributed representations such as thirst. Dissociating these behaviorally irrelevant neural dynamics from the behaviorally relevant ones is key in understanding how neural dynamics explain behavior. We develop a novel algorithm termed PSID for dissociating and modeling behaviorally relevant neural dynamics. PSID models the temporal structure of neural activity in terms of a latent brain state that dissociates the behaviorally relevant dynamics from other dynamics. First, with extensive numerical simulations, we show that PSID learns behaviorally relevant neural dynamics much more accurately, using orders of magnitude less training data and latent states with fewer dimensions. Next, we use PSID to study motor cortical dynamics in two non-human primates performing 3D reach-return movements toward targets while all joint angles in their upper-extremity were being tracked. PSID reveals that behaviorally relevant neural dynamics are markedly lower dimensional than implied by standard methods. In addition, PSID uncovers distinct rotational dynamics in neural activity during reach and return movements that are missed by standard methods and are significantly more predictive of behavior. Moreover, PSID learns more accurate behaviorally relevant dynamics from almost all recording channels and for almost all joints. Finally, to show that the benefit of PSID is due to its novel two-stage learning algorithm that considers both neural activity and behavior and can dissociate behaviorally relevant dynamics, we compare the results with example nonlinear modeling methods and find that PSID more accurately learns the behaviorally relevant neural dynamics. Taken together, PSID provides a new tool for studying and modeling behaviorally relevant neural dynamics that can otherwise be missed. PSID also serves as a dynamic dimension reduction method that can preserve behaviorally relevant neural dynamics. Finally, PSID can also be used to model shared dynamics between any two signals, e.g. neural activity in two brain regions.",Omid Sani,"Hamidreza Abbaspourazad, University of Southern California; Yan Wong, New York University; Bijan Pesaran, New York University; Maryam Shanechi, University of Southern California",University of Southern California (grid.42505.36),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-26 22:15:00+00:00,2020-10-26 22:30:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/Yq1ShXkkWyY
rectoGbyaggF1lwXL,Nonlinear stimulus representations in neural circuits with approximate excitatory-inhibitory balance,"Balanced excitation and inhibition is widely observed in cortex. How does this balance shape neural computations and stimulus representations? This question is often studied using computational models of neuronal networks in a dynamically balanced state. But balanced network models predict a linear relationship between stimuli and population responses. So how do cortical circuits implement nonlinear representations and computations? We show that every balanced network architecture admits stimuli that break the balanced state and these breaks in balance push the network into a “semi-balanced state” characterized by excess inhibition to some neurons, but an absence of excess excitation. The semi-balanced state produces nonlinear stimulus representations and nonlinear computations, is unavoidable in networks driven by multiple stimuli, is consistent with cortical recordings, and has a direct mathematical relationship to artificial neural networks. In addition, we study the synaptic plasticity and learnings in semi-balanced networks, and aim to build a more direct analogue between ANNs and neuronal networks in the cerebral cortex. This will open a highway of shared information between neuroscience and machine learning, resulting in rapid advances in each field.

Objective: In this systematic review, we describe the basis and types of nanoparticles utilized for treatment of GBM and further evaluate the outcomes of clinical trials involving nanotherapy in patients with GBM.
Methodology: Ten clinical trials conducted between 2001 until 2020 were analyzed the PRISMA 2009 guidelines. 225 patients were further sub-grouped as either primary or recurrent GBM.
Results: The primary outcome of median overall survival (mOS) was 8.2 months for the pooled sample, 6.75 months for primary GBM and 9.7 months for recurrent GBM.  The median KPS improved from 80 to 90 after therapy.  Number of adverse events due to nanotherapy were n=32 (14.2%). The results show that existing nanotherapeutic strategies were able to extend the survival as well as quality of life with an acceptable adverse event rate.

Moreover, existing ME estimators are constrained to binary signals, which limit their application to non-spiking, continuous signals. This works proposes the Q-Potts model from statistical physics as an alternative Maximum Entropy-based connectivity estimation framework which enables the use of signals with Q discrete levels. A comparison between Potts estimators using a range of Q parameters is carried out. The methods are compared across several network topologies, including common-input networks which have been shown to cause systematic errors across connectivity inference methods. Simulated data is generated from the topologies using  Multi-Variate Autoregressive (MVAR) Models and Dynamic Potts (DP) models. The Ising estimator, equivalent to a 2-Potts estimator, is shown to be a robust estimator of connectivity compared to higher-order Q-Potts estimator, even when data is generated with a model that matches the latter. When compared to widely used information-theoretic connectivity estimators, the Ising model performs at a similar level for data generated through MVAR models, and outperforms them in DP-generated models. While ME models remain susceptible to systematic errors in connectivity estimation, they are shown to be robust estimators of connectivity with some tolerance to model mismatch compared to other common methods. The possibility of hardware-accelerated inference for ME models make them a strong candidate for rapid online connectivity estimation for clinical purposes.

rectxwerMQYkLKHI0,Evidence accumulation determines conscious access,"A fundamental scientific question concerns the neuronal basis of perceptual consciousness, which can encompass both perceptual experience and reflexive monitoring associated with a sensory event. Although recent human studies identified individual neurons reflecting stimulus visibility, their functional role for perceptual consciousness remains unknown. Here, we provide neuronal and computational evidence indicating that perceptual and reflexive consciousness are governed by an all-or-none process involving accumulation of perceptual evidence. We recorded single-neuron activity in a participant with a microelectrode implant in the posterior parietal cortex, considered a substrate for evidence accumulation, while he detected vibrotactile stimuli around detection threshold and provided confidence estimates. We found that detected stimuli elicited firing rate patterns resembling evidence accumulation during decision-making, irrespective of response effectors. Similar neurons encoded the intensity of task-irrelevant stimuli, suggesting their role for consciousness per se, irrespective of report. We generalized these findings in healthy volunteers using electroencephalography and reproduced their behavioral and neural responses with a computational model of evidence accumulation. This model considered stimulus detection if accumulated evidence reached a bound, and confidence as the distance between maximal evidence (over time) and that bound. Apart from reproducing neural responses, detection rates and confidence ratings distributions, our model also reproduced higher variance for confidence in hits vs. misses and metacognitive sensitivity between participants. Applying this mechanism to our neuronal data, we were able to decode single-trial confidence ratings both for detected and undetected stimuli. Our results show that the specific gradual changes in neuronal dynamics during evidence accumulation govern perceptual consciousness and reflexive monitoring in humans. Furthermore, the model we propose offers a plausible mechanism for confidence in the absence of conscious detection.

recu84lnrLnyr6bfv,Multiscale low-dimensional neural dynamics underlie naturalistic reach-and-grasp movements,"Studies of low-dimensional dynamics of neural population activity have largely focused on analyses of spiking activity of a population of neurons. However, motor function involves multiple spatiotemporal scales of brain activity ranging from small-scale processes measured by spiking activity to larger-scale brain network activity reflected in local field potentials (LFP). How low-dimensional dynamics of spiking and LFP activity relate to each other remains elusive to date. Further, for naturalistic reach-and-grasp movements, low-dimensional neural dynamics are relatively under-explored even for spiking population activity. We learn novel multiscale latent state-space models for spiking, LFP and combined spike-LFP activities recorded from non-human primates performing a naturalistic reach-and-grasp movement to diverse locations in 3D space and continuously in time without a trial structure. We partitioned the latent state into several dynamical modes, each characterized with a unique decay-frequency pair which described how fast neural dynamics decayed in time and with what frequency they ringed over time. We then quantified how predictive of behavior each mode was. In both spiking and LFP network activity, there existed a mode that was dominantly predictive of behavior compared to other modes. Interestingly, while spiking and LFP network activity displayed several distinct modes, this predictive mode was shared between them, i.e. had similar decay-frequency characteristics. This implied that the predictive mode was multiscale. Interestingly, the multiscale predictive mode was also shared across sessions and monkeys, but was not simply a replicate of modes in behavior. Finally, the multiscale predictive mode existed in both low-frequency and high-frequency LFP bands. Multiple convergent analysis showed that both the multiscale predictive mode’s decay and frequency explained naturalistic behavior. The predictive mode’s time-decay was ~1s, which was longer than all other modes, suggesting that naturalistic behavior relies on integrating multiscale neural dynamics over longer time-periods. In addition, its frequency was ~0.2 Hz, characterizing how fast the underlying neural dynamics tended to rotate in time. We propose that multiscale, low-dimensional motor cortical dynamics underlie naturalistic reach-and-grasp movements due to the prominent role of large-scale brain networks in these movements.",Hamidreza Abbaspourazad,"Hamidreza Abbaspourazad, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California; Mahdi Choudhary, Center for Neural Science, New York University; Yan T Wong, Department of Physiology, Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University; Bijan Pesaran, Center for Neural Science, New York University; Maryam M Shanechi, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of Southern California",University of Southern California (grid.42505.36),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-28 22:30:00+00:00,2020-10-28 22:45:00+00:00,

As of recently, such multivariate methods have been commonly used to decode visual-spatial features such as location, orientation, or spatial frequency. In the current study, we show that it is also possible to track visual colour processing by using Linear Discriminant Analysis. Building on other recent demonstrations, we show that colour decoding: (1) reflects sensory qualities (as opposed to, for example, verbal labelling) with a prominent contribution from posterior electrodes contralateral to the stimulus, (2) conforms to a parametric coding space, (3) is influenced by luminance offsets but driven by chromaticity differences between stimuli (4) is possible in multi-item displays, and (5) is comparable in magnitude to the decoding of visual stimulus orientation. Through subsampling our data, we also provide an estimate of the approximate number of trials and participants required for robust decoding. Colour decoding opens a relevant new dimension in which to track visual processing using scalp EEG measurements, while bypassing potential confounds associated with decoding approaches that focus on spatial features.

Thirty years ago, an international scientific project (the Human Genome project) set the goal to identify, map, and understand all of human DNA and genes. Since this project’s completion in 2003, there has been an increase of interest in precision medicine or treatment plans personalized for an individual based on their genetic make up, environment, and lifestyle. However, the human reference genome generated from the human genome project was primarily assembled from European ancestry and had a stark underrepresentation of African ancestry. In this journal club, we will meet with the authors of the 2020 CellPress Report, Missing in Action: African Ancestry in Brain Research. We will learn how underrepresentation of African ancestry in research is related to health disparities in diagnosis and treatment and discuss future steps to create inclusive science and medicine.

recuDo2IK2NMIOWXZ,One-trial learning to new goal locations on a simulated delayed matching to place watermaze task by using minimal additions to an actor-critic architecture. ,"Animals, including humans, are able to learn new spatial locations after a single visit [1,2,6]. This property, also termed one-shot learning, is challenging to capture in artificial agents in biologically realistic set-ups, and its underlying mechanisms are the focus of ongoing experimental and theoretical research. Here, we present an  approach to modelling spatial learning and navigation of an agent in a circular open field maze, using Temporal Difference (TD) learning within an actor-critic architecture (using a discrete action-space adapted from [3] and a continuous action-space adapted from [6] implemented via a rate, rather than spiking, framework) [7]. This architecture enables to map locations to actions to reach a fixed goal in the space, leading to behaviours close to the one of rats in the standard memory test of the Morris watermaze [3]. However, this agent requires many trials to adjust to changing goal locations, therefore failing to reproduce one-shot learning as observed in the watermaze delayed-matching-to-place (DMP) task [1,2,6]. We present two minimal additions which enable to adjust to changing goal locations. First, a map-like representation of locations is used to compute a vector-based direction to the goal [3]. Second, a meta-critic unit [5] which shapes the exploration of the agent and selects a successful policy for the current situation. We compare the behaviour of these agents to the behaviour of rats in the watermaze DMP task.

recuF7m3eXUDzZGcR,Pulvinar input to visual cortex scrambles direction selectivity during saccades,"Sensory stimuli are often generated by the animal’s own movements. Many sensory systems suppress these self-induced inputs and selectively respond to externally generated stimuli, thereby maintaining the perceptual stability of the external world. Rapid eye movement, called saccades, generates motion of the visual scene on the retina. Several mechanisms have been proposed that prevent the perception of such motion. Yet, how they are implemented in the circuitry of visual cortex is poorly understood. Here, we focused on the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), where many neurons encode the motion direction of visual stimuli. We began by comparing the response of V1 neurons to spontaneous saccades with their response to external visual stimuli designed to mimic the motion of visual scene induced by saccades, which we termed “pseudo-saccades”. Many neurons showed direction selectivity for saccades (i.e., responded differently to saccades moving in opposite directions) as well as for pseudo-saccades. Interestingly, however, there was no correlation between the direction selectivity for the two conditions. Consequently, a downstream decoder that discriminates the direction of pseudo-saccades based on the population activity in V1 is unable to discriminate the direction of visual motion induced by actual saccades. Thus, in V1, direction selectivity is scrambled during saccades, and information about the direction of motion is suppressed. Where does this scrambling originate from? We discovered that V1 receives a non-visual input from the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus around the time of saccades. To determine whether this pulvinar input mediates the scrambling, we pharmacologically silenced the pulvinar. Upon silencing this thalamic nucleus, the direction selectivity for real saccades and pseudo-saccades became correlated. Thus, the pulvinar suppresses saccade-induced motion of the visual scene in V1 by scrambling direction selectivity.

recuGtxhzIIKhmLke,HAND SPECIFICITY AND INTERACTIONS WITH MOVEMENT PLANNING IN CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS,"To plan a reach or pointing movement, sensory information about the movement goal needs to be converted into a representation that specifies the desired movement with respect to the hand to be used. Here we use a pro/anti-pointing task that has been performed separately with the left and right hand and record MEG signals to investigate which brain areas in the reaching network reflect hand specificity. We also ask which of those areas are involved in computing a hand-specific movement plan as revealed by differences between both hands in the coding for the movement plan. We found eight areas that showed specific hand-related changes in oscillatory beta band power prior to movement onset: POJ, SPOC, IPL, SPL, VIP, S1, M1 and PMd. However, of those, only SPOC, IPL, VIP and M1 showed significant interactions between hand use and motor coding during movement planning, indicative of a hand-specific movement plan. Together with previous findings (Blohm, et al. 2019), we interpret these results as evidence for independent coding of the motor plan and hand use in areas POJ and PMd. In contrast, SPL and S1 seem to code for hand use, but might not represent an explicit motor plan. Finally, SPOC, IPL, VIP and M1 show evidence for a motor plan that is specific to the hand used.",Gunnar Blohm,"Gunnar Blohm, Centre of Neuroscience Studies, Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada; Douglas O.

recuHS6SeJcb7tAXB,Bipolar disorder alter topology and synchronizability of functional brain network,"Bipolar disorders (BD) is characterized by different functional changing in the brain. It adversely affect human behaviour, speech, and cognition. Furthermore, due to this disorders, people tend to make a decisions which may lead to negative consequences. The question then arises is what does happen in the brain in BD condition? Since the brain is known as a synchronized dynamic network, it is possible that any abnormality changes this synchronizability. In this study, we apply graph theory analysis to compare the organization of the functional brain networks between BD and normal control individual. The participants in this study consists of twenty- one individuals in BD conditions and the same number in the normal group. We tested the brains rhythms (derived from source localized EEG data) in the resting- state eye open (rsEO) condition. Graph theory analysis reveal that there are significant differences in theta wavelength in clustering coefficient (p=0.05; mean (BD)= 0.1283, SD= 0.0625; mean (control)= 0.0944, Std= 0.0526), global efficiency (p=0.04; mean (BD)= 0.1511, Std= 0.0645; mean (control)= 0.1140, Std= 0.0567), and second smallest eigen value (p=0.04; mean (BD)= -2.5115, Std= 1.0928; mean (control)= -1.9448, Std=  0.7094) between two groups.

discrimination remains intact in the near absence of attention. We used the well-established dual-task

vibrators. In the single-task, participants focused on one finger pair, while in the dual-task condition,
they focused on two finger pairs either on the same hand or across hands. Performance in the
dual-task was worse than in the single task. In contrast to previous visual experiments reported
improved performance when tasks were divided across hemifields compared to within a hemifield, we
did not find comparable result in the tactile modality. Specifically, we found that in the dual-task

recuURdgpRyoj1q3N,Temporally precise cholinergic signaling in the basal forebrain reflects reward-seeking and reinforcement during olfactory behavior.,"Sensory perception underlies how we internalize and interact with the world around us. In order to adapt to changing circumstances and interpret signals in a variety of contexts, sensation needs to be reliable, but perception of sensory input needs to be flexible. An important mediator of this flexibility is top-down regulation from cholinergic and GABAergic projection neurons in the basal forebrain. Basal forebrain projection neurons serve as pacemakers and gatekeepers for downstream neural networks, modulating circuit activity across neuronal populations in the cortex and hippocampus. This top-down control is necessary for sensory cue detection, learning, and memory, and is disproportionately disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases with symptoms of cognitive decline. Intriguingly, cholinergic signaling acts locally within the basal forebrain to sculpt the activity of basal forebrain output neurons. To determine how local cholinergic signaling impacts the basal forebrain output pathways that participate in top-down regulation, we sought to better define the dynamics of cholinergic signaling within the basal forebrain during motivated behavior and learning. Here we utilize fiber photometry and the genetically encoded acetylcholine indicator GAChR2.0 to determine temporal patterns of cholinergic signaling in the basal forebrain during olfactory-guided, motivated behaviors and learning. We show that cholinergic signaling reliably increases during reward seeking behaviors, but also reveal that cholinergic signaling in the basal forebrain is strongly suppressed by reward delivery in a Go/ No Go olfactory-cued discrimination learning task. Intriguingly, the observed transient reduction in cholinergic tone is mirrored by a suppression in basal forebrain GABAergic neuronal activity. Together, these results suggest that cholinergic tone in the basal forebrain changes rapidly to reflect engagement in goal-directed behavior, incorporate feedback signals, and impact basal forebrain circuit activity.",Liz Hanson,"Elizabeth Hanson, Baylor College of Medicine; Katie Brandel-Ankrapp, Baylor College of Medicine; Benjamin Arenkiel, Baylor College of Medicine",Baylor College of Medicine (grid.39382.33),"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 16:00:00+00:00,2020-10-29 16:15:00+00:00,
recuX3Ev12RWz5m7j,Shared neural activity patterns between facial expression and shape recognition,"Facial expressions are among the most informative stimuli we perceive: Even a split-second impression of a person's face gives us an estimate of their mood and direction of attention. Existing neurological evidence strongly suggests the existence of machinery dedicated to processing facial expressions in the human brain. We consider an essential shape recognition process gates this facial expression processing machinery.
Therefore, here we propose a hypothesis that the facial expression recognition mechanism shares some shape recognition steps in the visual system in the cortical areas. We tested this hypothesis using the fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project of 339 subjects performing an emotion processing task. Similar to the Hariri emotion task paradigm, the subjects matched fearful or angry facial expressions with expressions on the bottom of the screen and also matched geometric shapes like longitudinal and latitudinal ellipses.  
We separately analysed BOLD activations of the cortical surface regions of the two tasks using Multi-variate pattern analysis. We first selected the top 5% most active brain regions for both the tasks using ANOVA feature selection. These selected features using support vector machines linear kernel classified facial expressions recognition from resting-state with an accuracy of 83%. Similarly, for shape recognition, we got 81% accuracy.  Further, the selected areas in ventral stream visual cortex like Posterior Inferior Temporal, Fusiform Face Complex, VMV3 in a ventromedial visual area, which best correlated with object recognition, showed a high correlation with facial expression recognition as well. The other cortical regions involving primary and early visual cortical sectors were also common to both the recognition tasks, but with varying degrees of activation. Thus, these results indicate that facial expression recognition and shape recognition have shared neural activity patterns.

However, the majority of biologically-plausible learning algorithms have not yet reached the performance of backpropagation (BP), nor are they built on strong theoretical foundations. Here, we analyze target propagation (TP), a popular but not yet fully understood alternative to BP, from the standpoint of mathematical optimization. Our theory shows that TP is closely related to Gauss-Newton optimization and thus substantially differs from BP. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation of difference target propagation (DTP), a well-known variant of TP, in the realistic scenario of non-invertible neural networks. We provide a first solution to this problem through a novel reconstruction loss that improves feedback weight training, while simultaneously introducing architectural flexibility by allowing for direct feedback connections from the output to each hidden layer. Our theory is corroborated by experimental results that show significant improvements in performance and in the alignment of forward weight updates with loss gradients, compared to DTP.

recuihi7geycsVtXt,Biologically Plausible Fast and Statistical Sequence Learning with RNNs,"Two dilemmas exist on sequence learning in brains and artificial RNNs. The first is the nature and function of well-known reverse replay in the hippocampus, which is crucial to memory consolidation and sequence learning. Different models have been proposed regarding replay, while how replays support learning remains unclear. Neural activities in existing models are usually limited to “one-hot” representations, i.e., only one neuron (or geometrically clustered neurons) is transiently active during the replay period.  This prevents flexible high dimensional sequence learning. Second, the main training algorithm used for RNNs, Backpropagation through time (BPTT), is thought to be biologically implausible, since it requires cached storage of hidden and input layer activity across multiple time steps.

We propose here how a reverse replay RNN may act as a fast learning teacher (i.e. the hippocampus), which provides information to statistically train an RNN (i.e. memory consolidation in cortex).

To demonstrate this, we developed a gated RNN (fast learning) and a mutually coupled RNN (slow, statistical learning). The fast RNN forms stable line attractors in the neural state space (not one-hot). It utilizes oscillations to facilitate fast, stable sequence learning and arbitrarily bidirectional replay on random sequence patterns. The slow RNN consists of two neuron groups with mutual excitatory/inhibitory connections. With different E/I balance levels and the help of reversed inputs, this competition determines the network running direction, generating either forward or backward replays. These replays may train the slow RNN with the power of BPTT but with only local connectivity and plasticity rules, and no requirement to cache neural activities of previous time steps.

The coupled fast and slow RNNs may not only provide an alternative mechanism of biologically plausible sequence learning but also suggest how hippocampus and cortex produce memory consolidation.

recujV508jTV7ibU3,The Shallow Brain,"We present here a model for the core computational architecture that supports cognitive processes in the brain. We base our model on three premises: 1) The brain represents abstractions as groups of active neurons, here referred to as attractors. 2) Most learning is implemented by creating associations between abstractions, exemplified by classical conditioning or learning the many incremental associations we are taught in our first few decades of life that impress into our brains the distilled accumulated intelligence of our species. 3) Any combination of attractors can serve as either input or output for a given association. Together these suggest that the architecture of the brain is primarily an unstructured network, where new attractors can be created as new abstractions are learned, and associated with other attractors. The well-established STDP mechanism has been shown to support both the construction and association of attractors from an initially random network.
Such a network may account for aspects of cognition that are composed of explicit associations between identifiable abstractions, but likely does not support the unconscious, automatic, or intuitive processing that implement implicit thought. We hypothesize that the associative network of attractors is embedded in (and derives from) a background of randomly connected neurons, and that the action of the associative network can train this background network to implement implicit thought by exciting the desired output attractors and connecting them by STDP to active neurons in the background network, much as in reservoir learning. If this process is repeated using an incremental learning curriculum, the background network can develop elements that are functionally hierarchical, despite a lack of initial structure.
We note that the architecture described here is amenable to single-shot learning, and because it does not propagate signals for synaptic changes through the network, likely insensitive to catastrophic forgetting.

recumHPSKfOmlSl0E,Effects of Locomotion on Visual Responses in the Mouse Superior Colliculus,"Visual information captured by the retina is processed in parallel through two major pathways, one reaching the primary visual cortex through the thalamus, and the other projecting to the superior colliculus. The two pathways then merge in the higher areas of the visual cortex. The SC is a layered structure located in the midbrain which receives direct retinal input in its most superficial layer in which cells display tuning to particular visual features, notably motion direction in the upper superficial layer. 
Recent studies have shown that behavioral state such as locomotion is an essential component of vision and can strongly affect visual responses in the thalamocortical pathway. This effect is drastic in the primary visual cortex (V1), where locomotion profoundly increases visually-evoked responses. Here we investigate whether a similar effect exists in the SC. The need for consistent responses for threats regardless of prior knowledge suggest a robust encoding of visual information in this structure, which would translate into a stable tuning across behavioral states. By performing two-photon calcium imaging of head-fixed male and female mice running on a treadmill, we find that only a minority of neurons in the most superficial lamina of the SC display significant changes during locomotion. This modulation includes both increase and decrease in response amplitude and is similar between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The overall change in the SC is small, whereas V1 responses almost double during locomotion. Additionally, SC neurons display lower response variability and less spontaneous activity than V1 neurons. 
Together, these experiments indicate that locomotion-dependent modulation is not a widespread phenomenon in the early visual system and that the SC and V1 use different strategies to encode visual information. Our results reveal an important “division of labor” in visual processing between these two evolutionarily distinct structures

recuof8WFYxIbTKzW,On the necessity of recurrent processing during object recognition: it depends on the need for scene segmentation ,"While feed-forward activity may suffice for recognizing objects in sparse scenes, additional visual operations that aid object recognition might be needed for more complex scenes. One such additional operation is figure-ground segmentation; extracting the relevant features and locations of the target object while ignoring irrelevant features. In this study of 60 participants, we show objects on backgrounds of increasing complexity to investigate whether recurrent computations are increasingly important for segmenting objects from more complex backgrounds. Three lines of evidence show that recurrent processing is critical for recognition of objects embedded in complex scenes. First, behavioral results indicated a greater reduction in performance after masking objects presented on more complex backgrounds; with the degree of impairment increasing with increasing background complexity. Second, electroencephalography (EEG) measurements showed clear differences in the evoked response potentials (ERPs) between conditions around 200ms - a time point beyond feed-forward activity and object decoding based on the EEG signal indicated later decoding onsets for objects embedded in more complex backgrounds. Third, Deep Convolutional Neural Network performance confirmed this interpretation; feed-forward and less deep networks showed a higher degree of impairment in recognition for objects in complex backgrounds compared to recurrent and deeper networks. Together, these results support the notion that recurrent computations drive figure-ground segmentation of objects in complex scenes.",Noor Seijdel,"Jessica Loke, University of Amsterdam; Ron van de Klundert; Matthew van der Meer; Eva Quispel; Simon van Gaal, University of Amsterdam; Edward H.F. de Haan, University of Amsterdam; H.

recurvu20S9ZTifSQ,Vagus nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical and behavioral activation,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is currently used to manage a variety of neurological disorders, although the mechanisms underlying therapeutic benefits are unclear. We hypothesized that VNS may activate widespread regions of the brain via neuromodulatory projections and ultimately alter cortical and behavioral state. We tested this prediction in mice surgically implanted with a vagus nerve cuff electrode. Pupillometry and behavioral analysis in awake head-fixed mice demonstrated that VNS dose-dependently induces a change in behavioral state. Widefield calcium imaging of excitatory neurons revealed that VNS activates multiple regions of the cortex, including motor, somatosensory, retrosplenial, visual, and auditory cortical areas. Widespread cortical activation evoked by VNS was maintained under light isoflurane anesthesia, indicating that VNS activates the cortex above and beyond that resulting from VNS-induced motor activity. Two-photon calcium imaging and multiunit recordings of excitatory cortical neurons confirmed that VNS excites layer 2/3 cells in both awake and anesthetized states. The vagus nerve innervates the noradrenergic locus coeruleus which sends broad neuromodulatory projections throughout the brain including the cortex and the cholinergic basal forebrain.  Noradrenaline and acetylcholine are both heavily implicated in modulation of cortical and behavioral state, so we predicted that the observed effects of VNS on cortical excitation and arousal state may occur via activation of these neuromodulatory pathways. Using 2-photon calcium imaging of cortical axons we demonstrated that VNS activates both noradrenergic and cholinergic cells. Together, our results support a model of VNS in which stimulation results in activation of broadly projecting neuromodulatory systems, a widespread increase in cortical excitation, and an increase in arousal state.

recutAH7P0t7bTJrO,Dissecting learning and generalization of a continuous motor skill using a customized videogame,"How humans learn continuous motor skills, like a tennis serve, is a topic of great interest but remains controversial. One theory is that continuous movements in humans are made up of a sequence of discrete movement primitives. Movement primitives become sequenced into chunks that are then executed more efficiently. One prediction from the chunking model is that learning is sequence-specific, i.e. learning of one sequence of movements does not benefit the performance of a different sequence. We sought to test the chunking model by comparing the movement kinematics of continuous movements that were either well practiced or unpracticed. Human participants learned a continuous-movement skill that was implemented in a custom-built videogame. The game recorded participants’ movements as they learned to drive a virtual car along a narrow and winding track (the training track) by tilting a tablet computer using both wrists. To test for generalization, participants navigated a new track, the probe track, in a block of trials on their final day of participation. The probe track was the mirror-image of the training track, and so was matched for difficulty. Under the chunking model, performance on the probe track should have worsened compared to the training track. However, movement kinematics on the probe track matched those recorded on the training track, revealing that participants fully generalized. Performance, however, as measured by task success (remaining within the track boundaries) was worse for the probe track. Performance may transiently worsen compared to an individual’s average performance due to lapses, and an analysis of kinematics prior to task failure indicated that failures occurred in the same way on both tracks, while the frequency of lapses was higher on the probe. These findings are more consistent with learning a general control policy based on visited states rather than a chunked movement sequence. ",David Huberdeau,"Adrian M.

As neuroscientists, we can marvel at the tremendous breadth of discovery and innovation that has taken place within our field over these past three decades. But to what extent have the fruits of our labor been absorbed by the social and political systems which fostered them so closely? In a 2010 Supreme Court decision that forbid the lifetime imprisonment of juveniles for non-homicide crimes, the Court tipped its hat in the direction of developmental brain science. A handful of optimistic observers viewed the decision as heralding a new age of brain-based challenges to our conventional notions of criminal responsibility. Yet, this reality has yet to materialize and there is little to suggest that we can expect otherwise. In this talk, I will briefly discuss the short history of neuroscience and law. Then I will outline a few basic premises of how the legal system treats violent offenses. Finally, I will discuss work in which I have argued that neuroscience evidence of brain insults -- such as physical injury or lead intoxication -- should be used to reduce criminal responsibility for violent acts. Specifically, I will critically reflect on my previous scholarship pertaining to victims of battering relationships who are themselves accused of having participated in criminal conduct. A key question is: ""Why should I be responsible for my brain's output if another person has disrupted its function in a way that made me more likely to be violent?""

Though its neural mechanism is still not well understood, there is evidence suggested altered functional activity in the amygdala in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders during facial emotion tasks. The current study aims to compare the amygdala resting-state functional connectivity between patients across the schizo-bipolar spectrum and healthy controls as well as its correlation to the behavioral performance of a dynamic facial emotion recognition task (DARE). Method: Subjects were selected from a multi-site study (BSNIP) and they completed the DARE task and a resting-state fMRI scan. After removing scans with poor quality and excessive motion, the current study included a total of 346 subjects (healthy control: 126; schizophrenia: 84; schizoaffective disorder: 104; bipolar disorder with psychosis: 32). Amygdala was chosen as a region of interest (ROI) given its role in emotion processing, as well as reported changes in this region in the schizophrenia population in previous research. Age, gender, motion, and scanner sites were included as predictors of no interests. Results: Compared to healthy controls, there was a significantly (p-FWE<0.01) decreased functional connectivity to the right amygdala in the right insula and right planum polare in the patient group. Additionally, there was a significantly (p-FWE<0.01) decreased functional connectivity to the left amygdala in the left and right insula, right planum polare, and right supramarginal gyrus in patients compared to controls. However, amygdala functional connectivity was not significantly correlated with the overall facial emotion recognition accuracy in the DARE task.

Ideally, such tools are (1) noninvasive, (2) low-latency, and (3) provide interfaces to trigger external hardware based on posture (i.e., not just object based-tracking). Recent advances in pose estimation with deep learning allows researchers to train deep neural networks to accurately quantify a wide variety of animal behaviors. Here, we extend the DeepLabCut pose estimation toolbox to perform closed-loop feedback based on pose estimation in real time. First, we provide a new DeepLabCut-Live! package that serves as a simple API that facilitates incorporating DeepLabCut pose estimation into new or existing software for real-time, closed-loop feedback applications. Performance of this package was extensively tested on multiple hardware configurations and achieves rates > 150 FPS with reasonable image sizes (> 400 x 300 pixels) using GPUs. In addition to the DeepLabCut-Live! API, we provide three new software tools for implementing closed-loop feedback using DeepLabCut into experiments with ease: a stand-alone GUI (called DLC-Live! GUI), and integration of DeepLabCut into the experimental design frameworks Bonsai and AutoPilot. We benchmarked the performance of all three software packages, and observed closed loop feedback with delays as low as 10-15 ms using GPUs, and delays of 15-50 ms using inexpensive embedded systems (NVIDIA Jetson Developer Kits) or conventional computers with only CPUs. Furthermore, we describe an additional forward prediction module that can achieve sub-zero to zero-latency feedback.

recvX4UzOoh1Xzukk,Influence of dopamine signalling and oxidative metabolism on fluorescent advanced glycation end products formation in Drosophila melanogaster,"Dopamine (DA) is one of the major monoamines in the central nervus system. Disfunction in the DA synthesis, transport or signaling can lead to pathophysiological conditions associated with aging and neurodegeneration. DA influences glucose release, and high levels of free glucose can induce non-enzymatic glycation and covalent bonding of intra- and extra-cellular proteins resulting in the fluorescent Advanced Glycation End products (fAGEs). 
Our objectives were to investigate if DA could impact fAGEs formation in vitro, and in vivo. We have adapted a method for in vitro hydrothermal synthesis and semi-quantification of fAGEs. DA and its precursor L-DOPA inhibited fAGEs synthesis in vitro, as did the known plant flavonoid and antioxidant, quercetin (QUE). For in vivo study we used Drosophila melanogaster and have shown that increasing DA pools by feeding flies L-DOPA, or reducing DA pools by feeding 3-iodo tyrosine (3IY) did not influence fAGEs formation. The effect of manipulating DA transport and signalling on fAGEs formation was tested using mutant in dopamine transporter (DAT), fumin, and mutant in dopamine D1-type receptor dumb. Both, fumin and dumb had increased fAGEs formation. To test the influence of extracellular DA on fAGEs we fed wt flies cocaine (COC), a known DAT inhibitor, which increases DA in the synaptic cleft, and methamphetamine (METH) which increases DA efflux. COC and METH both increased fAGEs compared to control flies, and METH feeding led to higher fAGEs amount compared to COC. We hypothesized that oxidative metabolism of free cytosolic DA in METH treated flies could be one of the reasons for increased fAGEs. To test this we fed flies with combination of METH and QUE and have shown reduction in fAGEs.
Results from this study suggest that increase in fAGEs is associated with the impairment of DA transport and its oxidative metabolism. Since detection of fAGEs is easy and non-invasive method that can be performed on skin tissue in humans, our finding supports the use of fAGEs testing in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.

recvYNAx2WkqUKMJS,Investigating The role of cognitive systems in moral judgments according to social intuitionism and dual-process theory,"Emotionally demanding decision-making situations, with conflicting utilitarian and deontological consideration, would make moral dilemmas the most challenging decision-making scenarios. According to dual-process theory, the fast intuitive and slow rational systems contribute to decision makings. But the extent that each system imparts in making judgments remains unknown. As social intuitionism theory considers the role of deliberation just in post-hoc justifications. In the present study, we hypothesized that usually slow thinking is preceded by fast intuitive thinking unless the individuals are asked to provide reasons when making judgments. 
sample of 57 (female= 30, age (19-27), undergraduate students at Fasa University of Medical Sciences) participates voluntarily in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups. and were presented with six classic scenarios representing moral and reasoning dilemmas and were ask to judge the righteous of the action. Groups were different in concurrency of judgment and providing explanations, as group one, were asked to simultaneously judge actions and provide explanations; but group two weren't informed the need for explaining.  Then participants in either group were asked about their subjective inference of the judgments. Next, they had the chance to revise decisions. After this, all participants were asked to provide demographic data, and answers to Beck's Depression Inventory, and Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. 
The results indicate that the initial judgments were not affected by the grouping, and insufficient (p=0.06) to show group one tends more to revise their judgments. Also, revisions mostly happen in those scenarios subjects regards themselves emotional. Subjective inferences of judgments show a positive association of confident with being rational, and satisfaction, challenging with being annoyed and emotional. Female individuals tend more to revise but other variables such as obsession, and depression didn’t affect the judgments.
The study had limitations due to small sample size and lack of normalization. We didn't significantly show that the need for writing explanation would effectively induce the utilization of system two.

recvYUaNLleiMY8GJ,Local coupling between sleep spindles and slow oscillations supports consolidation of visuomotor adaptation,"The last decade has seen remarkable progress in the identification of the neural signatures of sleep-dependent consolidation. Yet, with rare exceptions, most advances have emerged from the field of declarative memory. This imbalance may obey to the substantial evidence suggesting that only hippocampal dependent tasks benefit from sleep. Overnight reactivation of hippocampal memories appears to depend on the precise synchrony between slow oscillations (SO) and sleep spindles. Here, we sought to examine whether this coupling is also critical for the consolidation of human motor memories. 
	We hypothesized that if the level of coupling between SO and spindles is also critical for the consolidation of motor memories then it should predict long-term memory overnight. Given that the role of sleep in sensorimotor adaptation is somewhat controversial, in Experiment 1 (n = 46) we tested this hypothesis by manipulating the proximity between visuomotor adaptation (VMA) and sleep. This procedure has been implemented successfully for declarative memories. We found that sleeping immediately after learning increased memory retention by 35% compared to sleeping 14 hours later (p<0.05), an effect that persisted for at least two weeks. Next, in Experiment 2, we sought to identify the neural signatures supporting sleep consolidation of visuomotor adaptation. To this end, a new set of subjects (n = 10) were exposed to a VMA session or a control session in which no perturbation was applied (CTL), and went to sleep 10 min later. We found that adaptation to a visual rotation increased the density of spindles during NREM3 over the electrodes contralateral to the trained hand (p=0.05). This effect was mostly driven by the electrodes placed over the left sensorimotor cortex. Although visuomotor adaptation did not affect the density of SOs (p>0.05), it substantially modulated the spindle-SO coupling in an inter-hemispheric manner (p<0.001), suggesting it may rather increase the ability of slow oscillations to promote thalamic spindles. Critically, spindles associated with a SO predicted long-term memory overnight, whereas uncoupled spindles didn’t.
	In conclusion, we have shown that sleep modulates the consolidation of visuomotor adaptation by increasing the level of coupling between spindles and slow oscillations in an inter-hemispheric manner during NREM3 sleep. Our findings provide compelling evidence for a role of the spindle-SO coupling in the stabilization of motor memories, and open the possibility of a common mechanism at the basis of procedural and declarative memory.",Agustin Solano,"Agustín Solano, IFIBIO Houssay-University of Buenos Aires; Luis A.

However, without ground truths, there is a real risk of missing a significant portion of the real responses. Here, we show that a common assumption, the non-negativity of the neuronal responses as detected by calcium indicators, biases all levels of the frequently used analytical methods for these data. From the extraction of meaningful fluorescence changes to spike inference and the analysis of inferred spikes, each step risks missing real responses because of the assumption of non-negativity. We first show that negative deviations from baseline can exist in calcium imaging of neuronal activity. Then, we use simulated data to test three popular algorithms for image analysis, finding that suite2p may be the best suited to large datasets. Spike inference algorithms also showed their limitations in dealing with inhibited neurons, and new approaches may be needed to address this problem. We further suggest avoiding data analysis approaches that may ignore inhibited responses in favor of a first exploratory step to ensure that none are present.

recvdLLkLC8qVOzft,Rhythmic Properties of Attention across Development,"Classically, attention has been understood as a constant and continuous process. However, recent evidence suggests that attention alternates rapidly between states of enhanced and diminished perceptual sensitivity. This rhythmic property, which facilitates environmental sampling during the allocation of attention, allows attention to be flexibly applied to the most relevant target at any moment. Importantly, these dynamic attentional state alternations can be measured at the behavioral level. In adults, this rhythmicity occurs in the theta range (3-8 Hz). While adult and non-human primate studies have shaped our understanding of these dynamic properties of attention, little is known about this rhythmicity during development. In this study we aim to determine the developmental trajectory of rhythmic properties of attention at the behavioral level and hypothesize that it becomes more adult-like with age. A barrier to studying this in childhood has been that tasks for revealing the rhythmicity of attention are long and demanding. We’ve implemented a foveal task that is accessible for children, yet still captures this rhythmicity. During this task children fixate on a central point while a blue dot cloud followed by a red dot cloud appears on the screen. The appearance of the red cloud serves as a cue and is followed by a random cue-target interval that varies between 250-750ms after which time, one of the two clouds changes slightly in contrast. The ability to detect this contrast change depends on the phase of attention at the time it occurs, thereby allowing us to quantify the frequency at which attention is rhythmically oscillating. We are collecting data for ages 6-8 and 11-13, and have so far collected data from 11 children in the older group, to determine if there is a significant difference in peak frequency between these age groups. If so, we will include more ages to get a more holistic picture of the developmental trajectory of rhythmicity in attention.",Ivette Planell-Mendez,"Ivette Planell-Mendez, Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University; Myrthe J.

recvl9Bt4fVGQLW2k,Coordinate transform mechanisms mediating tactile motion representations on the hand,"Humans’ hand dexterity is largely facilitated by the brain’s ability to provide invariant object representations regardless of how fingers enclose the object. When an object slips between our fingers, it is perceived sliding down regardless of whether the hand is in a pronated vs. supinated position. Yet, the motion on the skin is completely reversed across both hand postures. This dichotomy indicates that tactile motion representations are remapped into a coordinate frame that is controlled, at least in part, by proprioception. A fundamental question that arises is whether tactile motion coordinate transforms are anchored on a skin- vs. ego-centric reference frame. In the skin-centric frame, the brain computes the object’s motion by combining cutaneous signals with the spatial position of the hand. In the World-centric frame, the brain uses the position of external cues (e.g., the object’s position relative to the floor) to derive the object’s motion irrespective of hand position. Top-down mechanisms may also allow switching between reference frames to provide invariant motion representations relative to hand movements vs. movements of external objects.
We conducted a series of human psychophysics experiments to study coordinate transform mechanisms in the somatosensory system. We designed a tactile stimulator that delivers cutaneous motion stimuli with the hand placed in different postures. Data show that humans can readily switch between Hand-centric and World-centric reference frames when judging the direction of tactile motion stimuli. Data also show that vision biases proprioceptive representations that control the coordinate transforms of cutaneous motion stimuli. Taken together, these data indicate that tactile motion representations are derived by integrating cutaneous, proprioceptive and visual-spatial signals, and that the haptics sensorimotor network can flexibly shift reference frames to accommodate for the current task demands.

So far, procrastination does not mean forgetting the tasks, but rather completing less important tasks first while postponing and keeping more important in mind, we hypothesize, that mechanisms of shifting between tasks and mechanisms of prospective memory will be more active in procrastinators in comparison with non-procrastinators. Based on this assumption we conducted an event-related potentials (ERP) study on subjects with different level of procrastination. Subjects were divided into 2 groups with high (8 subjects) and low (7 subjects) level of procrastination based on Pure procrastination scale test. ERPs were recorded during three experimental conditions: under the load of perceptual prospective memory, under the load of conceptual prospective memory and under task-shift paradigm. Responses and corresponding reaction time were recorded as well. Here we present the results of response analysis. No significant differences between studied groups were obtained for perceptual prospective memory task. During conceptual prospective memory task, the number of correct answers was significantly higher in procrastinators, than in non-procrastinators. Giving wrong answers, non-procrastinators had significantly higher reaction time, than procrastinators did. For task shift activity, reaction time was higher in procrastinators in shift condition.

Among the genes deleted in the 22q11, six encode for mitochondrial proteins. Here, we examined mitochondrial genes expression in brain tissues of LgDel mice, a mouse model of 22q11DS (Meechan et al., 2009), and found that, among other mitochondrial-related genes, Bcl-Xl was specifically downregulated in cortical tissues and not in hippocampal tissues. We thus checked whether the decreased levels of Bcl-Xl could have a role in the neuroanatomical abnormalities associated to 22q11DS. At first, we analysed the mitochondrial distribution and the morphology of neurons in vivo by labelling single cells with a plasmid expressing a cytoplasmic fluorescent protein (mTAGBFP2) and a mitochondrial matrix-targeted fluorescent protein (mt-YFP) with IUE. Morphometric analysis of these parameters revealed remarkable differences between the LgDel and control mice. Then, we chronically treated LgDel mice with a biologically active peptide consisting of a domain of BCL-XL fused to the protein transduction domain of the HIV-TAT protein and found a significant rescue of mitochondrial phenotypes and a consistent improvement of the dendritic and spine abnormalities. Finally, the beneficial effect of TAT peptide was confirmed on cognitive deficits of LgDel mice.

This seamless integration enables a new class of implants with access to the central and peripheral nervous system and vital organs. Here we present a new class of tools that provide unparalleled capabilities to asses and modulate organ function and enable new experimental paradigms in a range of complex environments and contexts that cannot be explored with conventional technologies.

recvnqvj1ixUiiS26,Cognitive switches and prefrontal gating of flexible sensory processing,"Adaptive behaviour crucially depends on flexible decision-making, which in mammals relies on frontal cortex, specifically the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). How OFC encodes decision variables and instructs sensory areas to guide adaptive behaviour are key open questions. Here we developed a reversal learning task for head-fixed mice, monitored the activity of lateral OFC neurons using two-photon calcium imaging, and investigated how OFC dynamically interacts with primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Mice learned to discriminate go/no-go tactile stimuli and adapt their behaviour upon reversal of stimulus–reward contingency (‘rule-switch’). Imaging individual neurons longitudinally across all behavioural phases revealed a distinct engagement of S1 and lateral OFC: whereas S1 neural activity reflected initial task learning, lateral OFC neurons saliently and transiently responded to the rule-switch. Lateral OFC to S1 projections feed this activity as value-prediction error back to S1. This top-down signal updated sensory representations in S1 by functionally remapping responses in a small outcome-selective neuronal subpopulation that was also sensitive to reward history. Functional remapping crucially depended on top-down feedback as chemogenetic silencing of lateral OFC neurons disrupted reversal learning as well as plasticity of S1 neurons. The dynamic interaction of lateral OFC with sensory cortex thus implements history-dependent, prediction error-based computations and plasticity essential for flexible decision-making.

Their work could not be done without the use of issues, pull requests and merges, not any more. However, we have been waiting for a ""GitHub for science"" tool for a decade. Indeed, the technology needed to deal with research data specificities makes the repository administration very complex and time consuming, and requires relatively high computer skills. 

We have developed a toolkit to bring the power of GitHub to the researchers. Behind the scene, we are using advanced technologies: git-annex deals with large files; git modules brings access rights and publication at the sub-folder levels; gogs brings the github-like collaboration tool, and the tonic application (in go) facilitates and automates complex administrative tasks (like the creation of the research repo). Last but not least, we also worked on a folder structure template to facilitate and promote file sharing, reproducible research and research data management.

Similar to the beverage, gin-tonic was tricky to prepare, but now you can relax and enjoy it. Once installed, you only need to save your digital files at a right place and double-click synchronization files from time to time:  then you get access to all advanced features via your internet browser.

recvsDq7Fw85aPf7w,Abrupt transitions of response patterns emerging from gradual changes of network connectivity,"Recent experimental studies show substantial ongoing remodeling - even in the absence of an explicit learning paradigm - on both the level of synaptic connections [Loewenstein et al., 2011] and the level of neuronal population activity [Aschauer, Eppler et al., in review]. It is, however, unclear, how the changes in neuronal activity can be linked to changes in the underlying synaptic connectivity. 
To shed light on these phenomena we study a circuit model of randomly connected excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
For strong recurrent connectivity and a high ratio of inhibition to excitation, the model reproduces key characteristics of neuronal activity patterns of mouse auditory cortex, including sparse activity, a broad distribution of firing rates, and a clustering of stimuli into a set of response modes [Bathellier et al., 2012]. In this regime we also find that gradual changes of synaptic strength can result in periods of stable responses which are interrupted by abrupt transitions towards new response patterns. 
To understand the mechanism underlying these transitions, we analyze the fixed points of this network model, employing a method similar to [Sussilo and Barak, 2013]. 
The regime, where we find this clustering, is characterized by multiple fixed points per stimulus, i.e. one stimulus can evoke different responses depending on the initial conditions of the system. Analyzing how the fixed points of a network change during ongoing, random synaptic drift reveals that abrupt transitions of response patterns coincide with significant changes in the layout of fixed points. 
We conclude, that even slow ongoing synaptic changes can lead to abrupt transitions which can be inferred from the fixed point dynamics of the network.",Bastian Eppler,"Dominik Aschauer, JGU Mainz; Simon Rumpel, JGU Mainz; Matthias Kaschube, Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (grid.417999.b),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-27 10:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 10:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/SMUwA27jquw
recvtV5SPCKmW8ZXD,Visual Misrecognition Reveals Contradiction between Lower and Higher Visual Cortex Activations,"One trait that distinguishes human vision from artificial vision model is its relative robustness under conditions of uncertainty. It is generally believed that the immense connectivity between different visual areas allowing bottom-up, recurrent, and top-down connectivity patterns allows this trait. However, the integration mechanism that occurs between signals that pass through those connections is a big open question. To investigate this question, we use the concept of visual misrecognition under challenging conditions. This setting allows us to investigate the conditions when behavioral response does not match the visual content and how the brain responds to perception correction. We recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging signals while subjects watched blurred images of various difficulties. We then decoded the image category through a deep neural network proxy. We found that neural signals in the lower visual areas did not point to the same categories as the higher visual areas. The lower areas rather matched the actual existing stimulus signals while the deeper areas decoded categories matched those chosen by the subject. Additionally, higher visual areas appeared to point to the wrong category when subjects made a mistake but showed to switch direction after subjects corrected their choice as the blur level decreased following the subjects’ behavior consistently. These results reveal the dynamics of the higher visual areas as they switch their representation in response to additional visual data which could shed a light on their connectivity patterns.",Mohamed Abdelhack,"Yukiyasu Kamitani, Kyoto University and ATR",Washington University in St. Louis (grid.4367.6),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 21:30:00+00:00,2020-10-30 21:45:00+00:00,
recvwlOyvHfFzlMls,The Effects of Attention on Alpha and Afferent V1 Responses,"Endogenous shifts of attention towards an upcoming stimulus cause topographical shifts in alpha power and enhanced sensory evoked responses, and both of these changes are associated with improved perceptual processing of the stimulus. However, there is little examination of the relationship between attention-related alpha changes and attention-related sensory changes. Additionally, it is still inconclusive whether attention can affect the earliest cortical visual evoked response – the C1 ERP component – which is putatively generated from afferent input into V1. This study attempts to assess changes in the C1 related to attention, and related to prestimulus alpha, through a spatial-2AFC cued contrast discrimination task. A cue at central fixation indicates whether participants should shift their attention to the upper or lower visual field with 80% validity. Participants respond according to which of two stimuli has greater contrast, a variable that was parametrically manipulated to span individual’s psychometric functions. Preliminary findings (n=4, 1,000 trials each) show the expected improvements in speed and accuracy when responding to stimuli in the cued, as compared to the uncued, location. Upper and lower visual field cues differentially affected the topography of alpha power, confirming that participants were endogenously shifting attention. Despite the fact that the stimuli reliably elicited a strong C1 response, there is little evidence of an attention effect on the C1 component or changes in C1 amplitude related to prestimulus alpha power. Rather, attention seemed to induce changes in a late ERP component (the “central parietal positivity”; CPP) thought to index evidence accumulation. Our findings suggest that endogenous attention speeds up evidence accumulation independent of early sensory changes.",Audrey Morrow,Jason Samaha,"University of California, Santa Cruz (grid.205975.c)","Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-28 17:30:00+00:00,2020-10-28 17:45:00+00:00,

recw7TTSz3kp6HcnK,Delineating single subject oscillatory brain networks with Spatio-Spectral Eigenmodes,"The spatial and spectral structure of oscillatory networks in the brain provide a readout of the underlying neuronal function. Within and between subject variability in these networks can be highly informative but also poses a considerable analytic challenge. Here, we describe a method that simultaneously estimate spectral and spatial network structure without assumptions about either feature distorting estimation of the other. This enables analyses exploring how variability in the frequency and spatial structure of oscillatory networks might vary both across the brain and across individuals. 

The method performs a modal decomposition of an autoregressive model to describe the oscillatory signals present within a time-series based on their peak frequency and damping time. Moreover, an alternate mathematical formulation for the system transfer function can be written in terms of these oscillatory modes; describing the spatial topography and network structure of each component. We define a set of Spatio-Spectral Eigenmodes (SSEs) from these parameters to provide a parsimonious description of oscillatory networks. Crucially, the SSEs preserve the rich between-subject variability and are constructed without pre-averaging within specified frequency bands or limiting analyses to single channels or regions. 

After validating the method on simulated data, we explore the structure of whole brain oscillatory networks in eyes-open resting state MEG data from the Human Connectome Project. We are able to show a wide variability in peak frequency and network structure of alpha oscillations and reveal a distinction between occipital ‘high-frequency alpha’ and parietal ‘low-frequency alpha’. The frequency difference between occipital and parietal alpha components is present within individual participants but is partially masked by larger between subject variability; a 10Hz oscillation may represent the high-frequency occipital component in one participant and the low-frequency parietal component in another.

Channelrhodopsin 2 generated currents through the somato-dendritic membranes of excitatory neurons under precise temporal control. Constant excitation was transformed into strong synchronization in the gamma-band, revealing the well-known cortical resonance. Ramp stimulation demonstrated that the resonant frequency varied (30-60 Hz) with excitatory input strength, and Gaussian excitation exhibited hysteresis of power and frequency. Crucially, white-noise sequences enabled a causal analysis of network transmission, establishing preferential transmission of input components that are coherent to the resonance. Models composed of recurrently coupled excitatory and inhibitory units uncovered a crucial role of feedback inhibition and suggest that hysteresis can arise from the non-inactivating M-current.

recwHcxOdOC1oAyRZ,Predicting basal forebrain degeneration with plasma lipids in human Alzheimer's disease,"Cortical cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain is essential for normal cognitive functioning. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), basal forebrain cholinergic neurons degenerate before other neurotransmitter systems. Currently, our understanding as to what factors contribute to cholinergic selective vulnerability is limited. One proposed characteristic of cholinergic neurons which may render them more vulnerable to degeneration than other neurons is their dual use for the lipid phosphatidylcholine. While all neurons use phosphatidylcholine to build and repair their cell membranes, only cholinergic neurons use phosphatidylcholines to biosynthesize acetylcholine. 
Therefore, we hypothesized that if cholinergic neurons are selectively vulnerable to degeneration because of their high demand for phosphatidylcholines, then phosphatidylcholines should predict degeneration within the basal forebrain in human AD. To test our hypothesis, we leveraged multimodal data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants were divided into a normal cerebrospinal fluid (nCSF) group and an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) group based on their CSF ratios of phosphorylated tau and amyloid beta. We then quantified each participant’s longitudinal grey matter degeneration, indexed with structural magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analyses determined that plasma phosphatidylcholines predict longitudinal trajectories of basal forebrain grey matter integrity (p = 0.001 on 5000 permutation tests). Furthermore, this relationship was moderated by the presence of CSF pathology. Overall, this study provides in vivo evidence for a relationship between phosphatidylcholines and the structural integrity of the basal forebrain in human AD. This work supports a longstanding theory of cholinergic selective vulnerability to AD.

recwK1q8khC7nrX6b,Non-corrupting decision-making feedback to area MT,"In sensorimotor decision-making, internal representation of sensory stimuli is utilized for the generation of appropriate behavior for the context. For stimuli near perceptual threshold, the trial-by-trial activity of single neurons in many sensory areas is correlated with the animal's perceptual report. This correlation between variability in sensory neurons and perceptual decisions has often been attributed to feedforward readout of the neural activity by the downstream decision-making circuits. However the interpretation is quite ambiguous and the correlation could also originate via feedback from decision-making mechanisms downstream of the sensory representation. Its meaning can be better understood in the light of population-wide correlations among sensory neurons. 
The middle temporal (MT) area contains both sensory and choice information and is known to be the key sensory area for visual motion perception. Using a statistical nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique on single-trial ensemble recordings during perceptual-decision-making, we extracted low-dimensional latent factors that captured the population-wide fluctuations and dissected the particular contributions of sensory-driven versus choice-correlated activity in the low-dimensional population code.
We found that the latent factors strongly encoded the direction of the stimulus in a single dimension with a temporal signature similar to that of single MT neurons. If the downstream circuit were optimally utilizing this information, choice-correlated signals should be aligned with this stimulus encoding dimension. Thus the decision-making process may be corrupting the sensory representation. Surprisingly, we found that the sensory stimuli and choice variables are separate at the population level contradicting the optimal readout view. This misaligned choice information allows the feedforward sensory information to coexist with the decision-making process. The time course of these signals suggest that this misaligned contribution likely is feedback from the downstream areas.
This new insight postulates how neural systems can maintain a mixed representation while allowing learning and adaptation.

recwO2Hx1BLcc9n3i,The Sense of Joint Agency in Sensorimotor Interaction,"Computational models have provided important contributions to unveiling the mechanisms underlying individual action and the sense of self agency – the subjective feeling of being in control of our own actions. The development of computational models is even more necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying joint actions and the subjective experiences of control which emerge during this kind of situations. 
Understanding the partner and choosing mutually satisfactory strategies are key components in joint action and in the development of the sense of joint agency. The development of a partner representation is incorporated in the process of state estimation and, with the body predictions, determines the selection of the control strategies. Game theory - the study of strategic interaction of self-interested agents – constitutes a natural extension of optimal control when multiple agents are involved.
Here we propose a modular computational architecture, which integrates the classical motor control theories - optimal estimation and optimal control - and extends them to reconcile the sense of self and joint agency during interactions. 
Models and simulations based on optimal estimation and game theory provide insights regarding what we represent of a partner, which strategies we adopt and how these strategies evolve with time and training during joint action. They also provide a conceptual basis for extending the notion of self agency to that of joint agency. 
The sense of agency is described in probabilistic terms, as a dynamic decision process, which continuously evaluates the assumptions underlying each observer-controller pair of the proposed modular architecture. Agency relates to reasoning about ourselves: our role in the action, the perceived features of our body and environment, presence of additional partners or opponents; their actions and intentions. During movements, the sense of agency gates each control signal thus providing the basis for optimal action selection.

Uncontrolled variability in external factors that also predict memory performance, however, confounds the interpretation of these effects. By controlling
for a comprehensive set of external variables, we investigated the extent to which neural correlates of successful memory encoding
reflect variability in endogenous brain states. We show that external variables that reliably predict memory performance have relatively

Specifically, a general prediction of optimal Bayesian learning and inference is excess choice-related variability in the direction of neural sensitivity, f’ (Lange & Haefner 2020). We trained two macaque monkeys to switch between two coarse orientation discrimination tasks while we recorded simultaneously from dozens of V1 units using planar 10x10 multi-electrode arrays. This is a rich dataset, including neural data recorded over the course of learning and while monkeys randomly switched discrimination tasks, cued at the start of each trial.

Our experiment design and analysis pipeline include numerous stages designed to reduce possible confounds, such as the selection of neurons with diverse tuning properties, automatic outlier detection, spike detection designed to minimize spurious coincident spikes across channels, and regression methods that account for both pseudo-replication and measurement error. We were also able to recover post-mortem histology from these animals and thus assign each electrode on the array to a cortical layer. Our results on choice probabilities are consistent with Jasper et al (2019), who similarly used electrode arrays in V1.

There is no programming or computers involved, only biological matter and analogue circuits; a ‘wet-analogue’ instrument.

There is a surprising similarity in the way neural networks and analogue modular synthesizers function, in that for both, voltages are passed through components to produce data or sound. The neural interface we developed juxtaposes these two networks and in a sense creates a continuum that creates one unified network.

In this study, we investigated whether color also affects visual perception earlier in the visual processing hierarchy, using the flash-jump illusion. In this illusion when an apparent motion stimulus, i.e. a rectangular bar appearing at different locations along a trajectory, changes color at a single position, observers perceive this color change as occurring farther along the trajectory of motion. This mislocalization error has been shown to be dependent on responses in area V4, an intermediate stage in the ventral visual stream. Our results demonstrated that the color of the flash modulated the magnitude of the flash-jump effect such that participants reported less of a shift, i.e. a more veridical flash location, for both red and blue flashes, as compared to green and yellow. This pattern of color effects was present for both accuracy and precision in localizing the flash. Given that neural correlates of the flash jump effect are found in area V4, our findings suggest that color-dependent modulations of perceptual processes can occur as early as the intermediate stages of visual processing.

recwl4MH7Vx2H6LEg,I would have found it by now: Metacognitive contributions to search termination,"When searching for a target object among distractors, a robust finding in cognitive science is that search time varies as a function of the number of distractors and their similarity to the target object. This is true not only for the time taken to say a target is present, but also for the time taken to terminate a search and conclude that a target object is absent. However, while models of visual search have successfully characterized contributions to target detection (such as salience or pop-out), the mechanisms underpinning when to terminate a search and conclude that a target is absent are poorly understood. In other words, when do people decide to give up and conclude that nothing is there? One hypothesis is that efficient search termination involves metacognitive knowledge such as the expected difficulty of the search, target salience, or fluctuations in one’s attentional state. By focusing on the first few trials in a visual search task in a large online sample, here we control participants’ ability to base their search termination on metacognitive knowledge before engaging with the task, and to directly measure the effect of experience on the shaping of this knowledge. In a first pilot experiment (N=181), we find a qualitative change in search termination efficiency before and after experiencing finding a target, in line with a metacognitive learning account.",Matan Mazor,Stephen M.

recwvzSP3n6t5e9QD,The strategy of learning a new visuomotor skill and the underlying neural mechanisms are age-dependent,"Motor learning is accompanied by experience-dependent neural plasticity of motor-related areas in the brain. Oscillatory brain activity in the alpha and beta frequency bands has been identified as a possible neural marker of this process. Although an age-specific increase in desynchronization of alpha and beta power during movement is frequently reported, if and how old age affects functional reorganization after a period of motor practice is incompletely understood. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to determine the effects of age on task-related brain activation before and after motor skill acquisition and at 24-h retention of a mirror star tracing task. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess task-related power (TR-Power) in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz) frequency bands before, immediately after and 24-h after motor practice of a mirror star tracing task in younger (N=36, age=21.1±1.3yr) and older (N=36, age=70.4±4.1yr) adults. While both speed and accuracy of the motor task improved directly after practice in both age groups, younger adults only consolidated improvements in speed, whereas older adults only consolidated improvements in accuracy. In younger adults, task-related power was observed in the hemisphere contralateral to the practicing right hand, while older adults showed a more bilateral activation pattern. There was an increase in task-related alpha and beta desynchronization immediately, but not 24h after practice, indicative of early neural plasticity. Interestingly, this change in desynchronization after practice was larger for older compared to younger adults. Together, these results indicate that both the strategy for learning a mirror star tracing task as well as the underlying neural mechanisms are age-dependent. ",Margot Bootsma,"Simone R.

recx874QWp55HMsme,Spontaneous shifts of arousal state shape behavior in perceptual decision-making,"Arousal levels perpetually rise and fall to control behavior. While extreme arousal states clearly indicate behavioral extremes, from sleep to escape from danger, little is known about the behavioral relevance of intermediate arousal levels fluctuating spontaneously in waking humans. Here, we simultaneously monitored magnetoencephalography and pupil size in healthy volunteers (N=24) at rest and during a perceptual decision-making task with long inter-trial intervals. We first identified how the two commonly used markers of arousal - pupil size and spectral power of brain activity – relate to one another at rest, and then show how prestimulus fluctuations in these markers shape subsequent perceptual decisions. We found that spontaneously varying pupil size correlates with power of brain activity in all frequency bands and in all large-scale cortical networks. Prestimulus pupil size correlates with subsequent shifts in detection bias (c) and sensitivity (d’), which was fully explained by large-scale spectral power variation. When dissociated from pupil-linked state, delta power of dorsal attention and default networks predicts bias and alpha power of visual network predicts sensitivity. Spontaneous pupil constriction and dilation events correlate with large-scale brain activity as well, but not with behavior. Our results illuminate the large-scale electrophysiological neural correlates of pupil-linked arousal and show the effects of arousal states on human perceptual decision-making.

recxHbVIv8S3QXPJO,Representation learning for neural population activity with Neural Data Transformers,"Neural populations are theorized to have an underlying dynamical structure which drives the evolution of population activity over time. This structure can be explicitly modeled with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), leading to state of the art modeling methods such as latent factor analysis via dynamical systems (LFADS). 

However, explicitly modeling a recurrent state can require sequential processing of recorded activity, slowing real-time applications such as brain-computer interfaces or closed-loop control of network states. Here we introduce the Neural Data Transformer (NDT), a non-recurrent alternative. Its non-recurrence enables 3ms inference, comfortably within the loop time of real-time applications. In contrast, common LFADS inference times exceed 24 ms.

Though the NDT lacks an explicit dynamics model, it can still predict dynamical activity. We first evaluate the NDT on large synthetic datasets (i.e. an order of magnitude larger than real-world data) with autonomous dynamics of varying complexity. Here, the NDT accurately infers neural firing rates with performance that matches LFADS (i.e., within 1% R2). Further, we develop an NDT variant that better models non-autonomous dynamics. When tested on firing rate inference of synthetic data with unpredictable perturbations, the NDT achieves 0.73 R2, approaching the 0.83 R2 of LFADS. Finally, to test performance in smaller real-world datasets, we apply the NDT to motor cortical data from a monkey performing a reaching task. We show that the NDT uncovers representations that enable behavioral decoding within 15% of the performance achieved by LFADS, outperforming spike-smoothing.

Though the NDT’s speed and competent accuracy is already useful, the NDT is a forward-looking proposal. Transformers have attracted much attention in deep learning communities for their ability to scale to larger datasets and longer timescales than RNNs. We anticipate that new recording technologies, along with dataset standardization and aggregation, will further improve the NDT’s performance and applicability.",Joel Ye,"Chethan Pandarinath, Emory University and Georgia Institute of Technology",Georgia Institute of Technology (grid.213917.f),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-26 22:30:00+00:00,2020-10-26 22:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/lEXSdoIGNWY
recxPAsMTx1LyKUvN,Data-driven discovery of dynamical relationships within electroencephalographic spectra in sleep,"Sleep is a decidedly nonstationary and multiplex process, and its dynamics, as measured by electroencephalography, are marked by the coupled evolution of bandlimited activities. Many of these activities are tied to neurological processes involved in regeneration, learning and memory consolidation, and an open question in sleep epidemiology is how best to compactly quantify an individual's sleep dynamics in a data-driven manner, for demographic analysis. 

To address this question, we first apply a “cool-start” nonnegative matrix factorization technique to separate epoch-level spectrograms into nonindependent, nonstationary time and frequency factors. The frequency factors recapitulate classical frequency bands with well-known demographic correlates, but they also admit variability in these bands across individuals. The temporal factors are found suitable for fitting systems of ordinary differential equations, which can compactly describe how the frequency factors evolve and influence one another. 

We first apply this approach to data from the childhood adenotonsillectomy study (n=464), a publicly available sleep dataset. During the sleep onset period, highly significant linear differential interactions are found among individualized sigma, delta, and beta factors, essentially blindly confirming a previous model of those interactions. However, we find little evidence that sleep onset dynamics are trait-like in this sample. To conclude, we discuss several challenges in the method's implementation to sleep data at the epidemiological scale, as well as further potential applications to cross-species homology, sleep microarchitecture, and neural time-series outside sleep.

recxReoWNEe7CN8Uy,Effects of Traumatic Brain Injury on the structure of BA4a and BA4p,"Introduction: ALS is a universally fatal neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment. Recent reports (NEJM) suggest that subjects with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are 4 times more likely to develop ALS than non-TBI subjects. It is not clear why TBI should increase the incidence of ALS. The cortico-motoneurones - which originate in the posterior part of the motor cortex (BA4p) - have long been implicated in ALS. It is conceivable that TBI selectively damages BA4p that predisposes individuals to ALS. We hypothesised that subjects with TBI would have low grey matter density in the left BA4p compared to BA4a in TBI patients versus non-TBI. 

Methods: We used the open ADNI-DOD data set (https://ida.loni.usc.edu/login.jsp?project=ADNIDOD). Vietnam War Veterans (mean age = 68.8, ADNI-DOD) with a history of war-related TBI (n=55) and those without TBI (n=34) were included in the study. We initially explored the parcellation of the motor cortex into BA4a and BA4p regions from Freesurfer (5.3.0). 

Results: Our preliminary results show the total BA4 thickness in the left hemisphere was smaller, but does not show a significant decrease in thickness (t = 0.731, p-value = 0.4667) in TBI versus nTBI. The cortical thickness in the LH BA4p seem to show more thinning however this was not statistically significant compared to the LH BA4a or to control regions, in the initial sMRI analysis (BA4p, t = 1.2546, p-value = 0.2136; BA4a, t = 1.2546, p-value = 0.9503)

Conclusions: We report that the structures of the subdivisions of BA4 are differentially affected by TBI, implicating that the BA4p structure may be more critical in the development of motor neurone disease.

recxSBn3LuI15AKMj,Stability and Control of Walking at Various Speed-Slope Combinations,"Walking on sloped surfaces is a common part of navigating our streets and buildings. Understanding sloped walking is especially important because slopes are common as an alternative to stairs for people with disabilities. Persons with lower-limb disability are not able to adjust their gait to walk on slopes without direct neural control (Rábago et al. 2016). While past work has explored the differences in biomechanics between sloped and level ground walking (Pickle et al. 2016), there is very little work in understanding gait stability and control in walking on slopes. Here, we investigate how the foot placement control strategies used on level ground walking (Wang and Srinivasan, 2014) are modulated when walking on a slope. Using human subject experiments and computer simulations, we investigate how deviations in the center of mass states occurring due to small intrinsic perturbations, are corrected using foot placement during sloped walking. We collected kinematic data on healthy humans while walking on an inclined-treadmill during ascent for several speed-slope combinations. We fit linear models between hip states at mid-stance and the next foot position to infer control strategies of sloped walking. Furthermore, we simulated a walking controller using experimentally obtained linear coefficients on a computational point-mass telescoping leg model. The linear models and computer simulations show what aspects of the controller are preserved (foot placement control) and what aspects change (push-off or power stroke) as humans walk stably up a range of slopes. These findings will inform control of prosthetic limbs by providing a human-derived controller that is stable on both level-ground and slopes.",Aya Alwan,"Manoj Srinivasan, The Ohio State University; Nidhi Seethapathi, University of Pennsylvania",The Ohio State University (grid.261331.4),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 17:30:00+00:00,2020-10-30 17:45:00+00:00,

We aimed to extend research on the short-term benefits of Dance for PD and determine improvements over 3 years while participating in weekly classes. We collected EEG, mood (PANAS-X), cognitive (MMSE, PD-NMS & MDS-UPDRS Parts I, II & IV) and motor (MDS-UPDRS Part III) assessments with the goal to examine a continuous PD long-term program that can serve to compliment traditional medical treatments and examine whether disease progression is modified.  We conducted two studies: (1) examined the short-term benefits of dance (N=17) and (2) measured PD symptom progression over a 3-year period (N=32). Our results indicated that rsEEG global alpha power was highest after a single dance class in comparison to before, F(1,26) = 6.928, p < .025, η2 = .210. Individuals with PD participating in 3-yrs of dance showed no progression of motor symptoms across time (p=0.817).  Further no impairment was shown for daily living (p=0.329), motor experiences of daily living (p=0.540) and for non-motor complications (p=0.390).  To examine disease progression directly in our cohort, we matched data from Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative as our non-dance PD comparison group (PD-MJFF-Com).  A significant Group (PD-Dancers and PD-MJFF-Com) by Days interaction showed that PD who train in dance have less motor impairment (M=18.75) than PD-MJFF-Com who do not dance (M=24.61) and over time (p< 0.05). As expected, and in stark contrast to our PD-Dancers the PD-MJFF-Com showed motor impairment (UPDRS III) across time (p< 0.01). UPDRS I and II showed disease progression of PD over time (p<0.005), and (p<0.01), whereas UPDRS IV showed no progression (p= 0.365) over the same 2-year period.

recxXIeDQ20E1T4Rm,Neurophysiological Correlates of Dual Tasking in People with Parkinson’s Disease and Freezing of Gait,"Objective: Freezing of gait in people with Parkinson’s disease (PwP) is associated with executive dysfunction and motor preparation deficits. We have recently shown that electrophysiological markers of motor preparation, rather than decision-making, differentiate PwP with freezing of gait (FOG+) and without (FOG-) while sitting. To examine the effect of locomotion on these results, we measured behavioural and electrophysiological responses in PwP with and without FOG during a target response time task while sitting (single-task) and stepping-in-place (dual-task).  
Methods: Behavioural and electroencephalographic data were acquired from 18 PwP (eight FOG+) and seven young controls performing the task while sitting and stepping in place. 
Results: FOG+ had slower response times while stepping compared with sitting. However, response times were significantly faster while stepping compared with sitting for controls. Electrophysiological responses showed no difference in decision-making potentials (Centroparietal Positivity) between groups or conditions but there were differences in neurophysiological markers of response inhibition (N2) and motor preparation (Lateralized Readiness Potential, LRP) in FOG+ while performing a dual-task. 
Conclusion: This suggests that the addition of a second complex motor task (stepping-in-place) impacts automatic allocation of resources in FOG+, resulting in delayed response times.  The impact of locomotion on the generation of the N2 and LRP potentials, particularly in freezers, indirectly implies that these functions compete with locomotion for resources. 
Significance: In the setting of multiple complex tasks or cognitive impairment, severe motor dysfunction may result, leading to freezing of gait.

Currently iTBS is administered similarly across males and females, but it is not known whether iTBS’s mechanism of action is affected by patient sex. As hippocampal neurogenesis plays a critical role in stress adaptation and antidepressant course of action, we examined adult hippocampal neurogenesis in male and female mice following a chronic iTBS protocol similar to those used in the clinics. Although chronic iTBS does not exert dramatic effects on neurogenesis, we found that there is a trend for greater population of immature neurons after iTBS in males, but not females. Females do not respond to iTBS with respect to any hippocampal neurogenesis related measures. There is no effect on iTBS on survival of neurons born one week before stimulation for either sex. We also examined the morphology of new-born neurons and found that iTBS produced a trend for slight decrease in spines in stimulated animals compared to sham stimulated animals. New neurons generated in either sex have a normal morphology, similar to non-stimulated control animals, with the exception of females overall have lower total dendritic length compared to males. Otherwise, all comparisons between male and female new-born neurons are consistent with each other, indicating that baseline neurogenesis levels and new-born neuron morphological features are comparable between sexes. Our findings suggest that iTBS’s primary target on neuroplasticity may not be adult hippocampal neurogenesis, however there may be physiological differences of new-born neurons that are influenced by iTBS that remains to be further explored.

recxeiZ9jvhkIWNf0,Does functional connectivity reflect anatomical connectivity? A simulation study,"        The human brain is a complicated network of 100 billion neurons connected by 100 trillion synapses. Experiments attempting to calculate connectivity typically quantify “functional connectivity,” or large-scale statistical correlations in activity between brain regions. Despite the prevalence of functional connectivity studies in neuroscience, there is no clear understanding of how it relates to anatomical synaptic connectivity. In this work we develop a platform to characterize the relationship between the two forms of connectivity.
	Our platform consists of a large-scale (>100,000 neuron) simulation of virtual neurons with connectivity structure mimicking that of a section of primate cortex. This simulation generates readouts of voltages at surface and intracortical locations, analogous to how local-field potential (LFP) recordings are sampled from the cortex via electrodes. The model corresponds to a section of primate cortex of size 1.5mm x 1.5mm x 2.6mm, which is on the order of recent experiments quantifying functional connectivity between electrodes on a neural implant, such as between Utah array electrodes (Bloch 2019). The model is developed using VERTEX (Tomsett 2015), and the connectivity structure is largely informed by (Binzegger 2004).
        Using our platform we calculate functional connectivity metrics from the recorded LFP signals and compare them to the virtual anatomical connectivity specified by the model. We first compute anatomical connectivity strength between distinct electrode locations. We then compute standard functional connectivity metrics such as coherence and Granger causality from the LFP signals collected from the electrodes, and use correlational analysis to investigate their relationship. 
        Functional connectivity is a contentious topic in neuroscience. Although studies investigating functional connectivity are widespread, its synaptic underpinnings remain mysterious. In this work we develop a computational platform to calculate functional and anatomical connectivity in a biorealistic virtual brain, and characterize their relationship to a degree that until now has been impossible.

Therefore, there is an increasing need to find new methods for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s in its presymptomatic phase. This presents some challenges because the disease is thought to start way before clinical symptoms emerge.

We characterized the live spontaneous calcium dynamics of neurons and glia throughout the layers of murine retinas expressing GCaMP6f in neurons and glia (under the NG2 promoter) at key developmental stages: Stage II retinal Waves (P10-11), Eye opening (P14-15), Early vision (P20-22), and Adult Vision (P60-90). Calcium dynamics were imaged using multiphoton microscopy on live ex-vivo retinal explants of 6 mice per condition.
Groups of Muller glia displayed spontaneous burst of calcium fluorescence, in a coordinated manner, and displaying a radial propagation profile. These spontaneous coordinated events were abolished by the pharmacological application of glutamate antagonists, indicating a potential point of origin. Interestingly, these events only appeared regularly after eye opening.

Little is known, however, about how gamma oscillations are related to individual differences in perception, and in particular, how it is related to sensitivity to sensory stimuli. In a recent magnetoencephalography (MEG) study in a sample of neurotypical males and in males with ASD we found that less efficient gamma response (GR) suppression in response to increase of motion of high-contrast gratings is associated with greater sensory sensitivity to stimuli in the everyday life. In this MEG study we replicated this result in a sample of neurotypical females. We found that efficacy of GR attenuation by  visual stimuli of different intensity predicts individual differences in sensory sensitivity. This finding extends our previous result and demonstrates that the observed correlation is not sex-specific.

Identity specification and wiring precision in the circuit that stabilizes gaze is a particular case of this general developmental problem. Vertebrates stabilize gaze using excitatory vestibular interneurons that relay head and body destabilization to motoneurons that counter-rotate the eyes. Precise connectivity between directionally-sensitive interneuron subtypes and particular motoneurons is therefore crucial for behavior. The developmental mechanisms that specify excitatory vestibular interneuron identity and connectivity are unresolved, though previous work has suggested a role for spatiotemporal cues and/or motoneuron-derived factors. We tested these hypotheses in the tangential nucleus (TAN) of the larval zebrafish, which contains the excitatory vestibular interneurons necessary for vertical gaze stabilization. We first developed an assay using 2-photon and swept, confocally-aligned planar excitation (SCAPE) microscopy to rapidly and reliably define functional nose-up and nose-down vestibular interneuron subtypes. We used this assay to ask whether functional subtypes are spatiotemporally organized and discovered functional organization complementary to spatiotemporal development. Our results are the first demonstration of functional sub-organization within a vestibular nucleus and reflect a putative role for spatiotemporal factors in identity specification. Next, to investigate the requirement of motoneuron-derived signals for TAN identity specification, we used these functional assays to measure changes in TAN identity following constitutive motoneuron knockouts. Our results demonstrate that TAN functional identity and organization is preserved in the absence of motoneurons, arguing against a role for motoneuron-derived cues. Taken together, we predict that spatiotemporally-linked factors organize TAN subtypes into dorsoventral and rostrocaudal microdomains.

However, it’s unclear whether sleep features of central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) causally interplay in supporting different types of sleep-dependent cognitive enhancement. Here, we used Zolpidem to manipulate spindles (measured by sigma power) and vagal activity (measured by high-frequency HRV; HF) and investigated the trade-off between improvement in LTM and WM performance. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subjects design (N=38; Mage = 20.85 ± 2.97 years, 19 Females) to test if Zolpidem increases performance on a word paired-associates task by boosting spindles, while decrease performance on the operation-span WM task by suppressing vagal tone, during the night of sleep. We explored the impact of Zolpidem on ANS profiles during sleep and showed that Zolpidem increased heart rate and decreased vagal activity during sleep, suggesting a vagolytic effect. Also, Zolpidem increased LTM retention but decreased overnight WM improvement, compared to Placebo. We found a positive correlation between WM improvement and vagal activity, while a negative correlation between LTM retention and vagal activity, suggested a functional role of vagal activity on WM and LTM. Using effective connectivity, we showed that Zolpidem increased the causal effect of sigma on HF. Such causal information flow was correlated with the difference between overnight LTM and WM changes: the more sigma’s causal effect over HF, the more hippocampal-dependent sleep benefits (LTM) than the prefrontal-dependent task (WM). These findings suggested a causal role of vagal activity on sleep-dependent cognition, and an antagonist role of spindles and vagal activity, which implicates a trade-off between LTM and WM processing during sleep.",Pin-Chun Chen,"Hamid Niknazar, University of California Irvine; Lauren N.

recxx3xJTZ92z0Idm,A Neural Coactivity Code for Dynamic Memory,"Information is encoded in the combined activity of multiple neurons. Notably, millisecond-timescale coactivity provides fundamental building blocks for some neural codes. Such short-timescale coactivity binds neurons with related tuning to external variables, giving rise to population-based representations congruent with those of their participating neurons. Alternatively, groups of neurons that are not individually tuned to a given variable may nevertheless encode such a variable as a function of their coactivity. While this type of emergent coding has been described for physically well-defined variables such as specific sensory inputs and actions, its possible cognitive function has not been explored. Here we show that coactivity-based representations provide a neural code for dynamic memories, where animals rapidly learn and flexibly retrieve short-lived behavioural contingencies every day. We trained mice to discriminate two new behavioural contingencies each day, while monitoring and manipulating neural ensembles in the hippocampal CA1. We found that short-timescale coactivity contained robust contingency information. Unlike coactivity patterns encoding space, which comprised neurons with overlapping place fields, coactivity-based contingency discrimination was unrelated to the tuning of individual neurons but instead an emergent property of their combined activity. Such millisecond, but not longer, timescale coactivity was flexibly reinstated to predict trial-by-trial memory performance. Moreover, optogenetic suppression of synaptic inputs from the upstream CA3 region selectively during learning impaired coactivity-based contingency information in CA1 and subsequent dynamic memory retrieval. These findings show that short-timescale coactivity stitches together individually untuned neurons to represent abstract, task-relevant variables in support of dynamic memory retrieval. Millisecond coactivity-based representations may preferentially exhibit the rapid dynamics needed to mnemonically process short-lived cognitive variables.",Mohamady El-Gaby,Hayley M Reeve; Vítor Lopes-dos-Santos; Natalia Campo-Urriza; Pavel V Perestenko; Alexander Morley; Lauren Strickland; István P Lukács; Ole Paulsen; David Dupret,University of Oxford,"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 16:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 16:45:00+00:00,
recxxV0XsnE7xFe7v,Hebbian plasticity in parallel synaptic pathways: A circuit mechanism for systems memory consolidation,"Systems memory consolidation can transfer declarative memories which initially depend on the hippocampal formation into long-term memory traces in neocortical networks. This consolidation process is thought to involve the replay of recently acquired memories, but the cellular and network mechanisms that mediate the memory transfer are poorly understood. Here, we suggest that systems memory consolidation could arise from Hebbian plasticity in networks with parallel synaptic pathways — two ubiquitous features of neural circuits in the brain.
We explore this hypothesis in a computational model and show that it is in quantitative agreement with lesion studies in rodents and that the mechanism can be hierarchically iterated to yield power-law forgetting as observed in psychophysical studies in humans.
Further, we show that the proposed mechanism can lead to the forgetting of episodic details in memories and the extraction of semantic generalizations, whereby neural replay enhances the speed of consolidation and can even be necessary for the extraction of semantic memories.
Finally, we hypothesize that the hierarchical iteration of the mechanism may provide a mechanistic basis for the spatial and temporal gradients of episodic and semantic memories observed in lesion studies, which suggest that episodic content decreases and semantic content increase with distance from the hippocampus.

While both phenomena can act on the same cortical circuit, it is unknown whether they rely on the same mechanisms. We imaged activity of the same neuronal populations in primary visual cortex as mice learned a visual discrimination task and subsequently performed an attentional switching task. Selectivity changes due to learning and attention were largely uncorrelated at the single-cell level. Selectivity increases after learning were mainly due to selective suppression of responses to one of the task relevant stimuli but relied on both selective enhancement and suppression during attention. Furthermore, learning and attention differentially affected interactions between excitatory and different inhibitory cell classes. Circuit modelling revealed that cell class specific top-down inputs best explained attention modulation, while reorganization of local functional connectivity accounts for specific learning related changes. These results suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie increased discriminability of relevant sensory stimuli across longer and shorter time scales.",Adil Khan,Jasper Poort; Katharina Wilmes; Antonin Blot; Angus Chadwick; Maneesh Sahani; Claudia Clopath; Thomas Mrsic-Flogel; Sonja Hofer,King's College London,"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 21:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 21:45:00+00:00,

In this work we study the structure and synchronization dynamics of adaptive networks of  Sakaguchi-Kuramoto oscillators based on Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules. We show that following anti-Hebbian learning the structure of network is gradually evolved such that the global synchronization is enhanced. On the other hand,  Hebbian learning  leads to the local synchronization and clustering structure of the network. Moreover, in the presence of frustration the connectivity patterns of the oscillators changes asymmetrically with respect to the mean frequency of the oscillators. In other words, the connectivity patterns of the oscillators with high and low natural frequencies would be different in the evolved networks. Previous studies have also shown that oscillators on the human connectome  follow a hierarchy of timescales, i.e.  highly connected regions have low natural frequencies and peripheral regions have high natural frequencies. In addition, we found that the value of the frustration parameter affects the size and the number of the clusters in the networks that are evolved based on the Hebbian learning rule.

recyKtPdkiBFs5vBW,Population coding of saccadic eye movements by Purkinje cells of the marmoset cerebellum,"To move accurately, the brain relies on the cerebellum to build internal models that predict the consequences of motor commands. A major difficulty has been to understand the language with which the cerebellum encodes internal models. For example, while damage to the cerebellum impairs the timing of commands that control saccadic eye movements, resulting in dysmetria, activities of individual Purkinje cells (P-cells) have no obvious relationship with the ongoing movement: P-cell activity during saccades are often modulated much longer than movement duration. However, anatomy of the cerebellum suggests that P-cells organize in small groups, together projecting onto a single output nucleus neuron. This anatomy implies that the fundamental computational unit of the cerebellum is not a single P-cell, but a population of P-cells. The critical problem is to identify the membership of each population. We recently hypothesized that P-cells that belong to a single population may be identified by a critical feature: they receive a common error signal from the inferior olive [1,2]. Thus, P-cells that belong to a single population may share the same complex spike tuning. Our earlier work in macaques had found evidence for this conjecture. Here, we tested the generality of this conjecture across primates by recording from the marmoset cerebellum. 
We trained two monkeys [3] to perform visually guided saccades (Fig. 1). To induce errors, we moved the target during the saccade, thus producing a visual prediction error at the offset of a saccade. We used multi-contact electrodes to simultaneously isolate multiple P-cells within and across various lobules of the vermis, finding strong saccade related activity in lobules VIIa and VIIb. We recorded from 110 well-isolated P-cells from two marmosets (65 P-cells from monkey M, 45 P-cells from monkey R), as identified via their simple and complex spikes (Fig. 2). Each P-cell recording included an average of 485±300 (mean±std) correct trials (53,000 total trials). On average, P-cells had simple spike (SS) firing rate of 62.5±17.5 Hz and complex spike (CS) firing rate of 0.85±0.18 Hz (mean±std). We observed that upon presentation of a visual stimulus, the P-cells produced a CS with a probability that depended on the direction of the visual stimulus with respect to the fovea (Fig. 3). That is, each P-cell had a complex spike tuning with respect to stimulus direction. As the saccade took place, we moved the primary target to a random location (Fig. 1B). This induced an error, encouraging the monkey to produce a secondary saccade. The P-cells produced a CS in response to this visual error, and the tuning of CS in the period before the corrective saccade was similar to the tuning with respect to the primary saccade (Fig. 3B). Thus, P-cells in the oculomotor vermis each had preference for a specific visual error (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the SS of individual P-cells were quite diverse: pausing in some directions, bursting in some directions, and a mixture of the two in other directions (Fig. 2B). Critically, SS modulation often outlasted the saccade by about 100ms. Remarkably, when P-cells were organized into a population based on their CS tuning (CS-on), the resulting population response precisely predicted the duration of the saccade (Fig. 4). For example, when the saccade was toward the CS+180 direction, the population response exhibited activity that resembled acceleration of the eyes. 
	In summary, our results demonstrate that across two species of primates, population coding in the cerebellum may be via a collection of P-cells that share the same preference for error. When P-cells that share the same CS tuning are organized into a population, their combined SS response predicts motion of the eye.",Ehsan Sedaghat-Nejad,"Paul Hage, Jay Pi, Reza Shadmehr",Johns Hopkins University (grid.21107.35),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-28 17:30:00+00:00,2020-10-28 17:45:00+00:00,
recyLDmq4AMWfVeSQ,Evidence of Social Buffering in Rats Housed in Individually Ventilated Cages (IVCs),"Rodent research facilities are increasingly adopting the use of individually ventilated cages (IVCs), despite initial evidence that these hermetically sealed housing units might be inherently stressful. As well, maintaining IVCs under positive air pressure could be more stressful than negative air pressure, in that the former (but not the latter) completely isolates rodents from the smells and sounds of other conspecifics in the colony. We asked if social housing, known to buffer rats’ responses to acute and/or chronic stress, serves a similar, protective role when rodents are housed in IVCs, and further, whether “social buffering” depends on the type of air pressure adopted. Rats were randomly assigned to either single- or paired-housing in each of the two air pressure conditions. After eight weeks in their respective housing condition, rats were tested in the shock-probe burying test, and then their brain tissue was processed to determine oxytocin-immunoreactivity (OT-ir) in the hypothalamus. Independent of air pressure, single-housed rats displayed marked reductions in probe burying relative to pair-housed rats. Given that chronic stress reduces active coping responses, including shock-probe burying, it might be the case that chronic stress-related outcomes linked to IVCs can be buffered by social housing. Our OT findings partially support this, in that the number of OT-ir cells was reduced in the posterior parvocellular region of the PVN of single-housed rats, but only if they were housed under negative air pressure. This suggests that these effects of air pressure condition were buffered by social housing. These findings inform efforts to improve housing conditions for animals used in research.

However, the underlying dynamic changes in neuronal activity during the flexible execution of working memory tasks are still largely unknown. Here, we assess the neural oscillatory rhythms of high-density local field potentials (LFP) recorded using a 64 chronic electrode array implanted in the lateral prefrontal cortex from 225 sessions from two monkey.  Oscillatory dynamics such as distinct and bandlimited phase synchronization at the millisecond range is a ubiquitous signature of neuronal processing for basic and high-order control function. We used weighted-phase lag index (w-PLI) as index of the LFP synchronization. We found that phase synchronization of LFP at the beta frequency (20-35 Hz) oscillations was enhanced during training to perform a working memory task. Neuronal oscillations were more synchronized in the beta frequency range during correct than incorrect trials. Neuronal oscillations in error trials desynchronized especially during the stimulus presentation periods, as compared to baseline period in beta frequency.  The preferred phase is initiated the synchronization or desynchronization of the neural oscillatory dynamics for cognitive control. These findings demonstrate that plastic formation induces in working memory by responsive neural activity. Importantly, these finding suggest the notion that preferred phase in specific frequency strengthen the synchronization among proximal and distal local field potentials.",Balbir Singh,"Dr. Mitchell Riley, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Department of Psychology, Vanderbilt University; Dr. Xue-Lian Qi, Wake Forest School of Medicine;Dr. Christos Constantinidis,Wake Forest School of Medicine",Wake Forest School of Medicine,"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-27 10:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 10:45:00+00:00,
recySVPjqjywyjehe,Sensorimotor adaptation by task-irrelevant feedback,"Learning by doing is the first tenet of sensorimotor learning. Some motor learning methods, e.g., observational learning, circumvent physical practice of actions, but they still demand deliberate mental simulation of to-be-learned actions with the aid of task-relevant feedback. Here we demonstrate that people can obtain long-term learning in a sensorimotor adaptation task based on task-irrelevant feedback. Participants were required to control a hand-cursor to reach to a target while ignoring a directionally-deviated cursor (the double cursor) moving simultaneously with the hand. Participants were able to suppress this task-irrelevant cursor's influence and perform the task without any sign of implicit learning or adaptive strategy. However, in delayed retention tests, they adapted significantly faster to a standard visuomotor rotation perturbation than naïve controls. Participants also showed this saving effect if the double cursor moved in the opposite direction of the visuomotor rotation in the retention test, if it moved with a random direction, or if it moved in mirror-symmetrical directions (mirror reaching is widely regarded as a skill acquisition task). Thus, given that the effect is direction-invariant and across-task, it appears that participants abstract the spatial relationship of visuomotor rotation from the double cursor. They did not show any implicit learning or explicit strategy initially, and their savings was supported only by the faster formation of explicit motor strategies.  Furthermore, we found no saving effect if the double cursor was not directionally deviated but amplitude scaled to the actual hand movement, further collaborating that people deduce an angular concept from the task-irrelevant feedback. Hence, sensorimotor adaptation can be facilitated without deliberate practice and without overt behavioral measures such as explicit strategy or aftereffect. While sensorimotor adaptation is widely considered as a combination of explicit strategy and implicit adaptation, our findings suggest that the motor concept, perhaps a third component, might affect adaptation.",Kunlin Wei," Kunlin Wei, Yajie Liu, Wanyin Jiang, Yuqing Bi",Peking University (grid.11135.37),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-29 09:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 09:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/3Evo2oaDbxA

Accessible and non-invasive methods of diagnosing and characterising AD are therefore desirable. Electroencephalography (EEG) fulfils these criteria and is often used when studying AD. Several features derived from EEG were shown to be able to predict AD with high accuracies, e.g. signal complexity and synchronisation. However, the dynamics of how the brain transitions between stable states have not been properly studied in case of AD and EEG data. Energy landscape analysis is a method that can be used to quantify these dynamics. This work presents the first application of this method to both AD and EEG. Energy landscape assigns energy value to each possible state, i.e. pattern of activations. The energy is inversely proportional to probability of occurrence. Therefore, high energy states have low probability of occurrence. Studying the features of energy landscapes of 20 AD patients and their healthy age-matched counterparts, significant differences were found. The dynamics of AD patients’ EEG were showed to oscillate between more stable states. Moreover, the pathways used for transitions between stable states in AD patients were found to be longer. Finally, we show that features derived from energy landscapes can potentially be used for predicting AD with high accuracy. The results reported in this work suggest that brains of AD patients adapt to the damage and death of neurons by finding novel albeit suboptimal pathways for transitioning between stable states.",Dominik Klepl (He/his),"Fei He, Coventry University",Coventry University (grid.8096.7),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-30 12:30:00+00:00,2020-10-30 12:45:00+00:00,

recybLzApdoj6wQQ0,The role of frontal cortex in multisensory decision-making,"The ability to combine visual and auditory cues to localize objects in space is critical to many organisms, whether prey, predator, or pedestrian crossing the street. Recent studies have shown that the mouse frontal cortex plays a key role in transforming sensory stimuli into appropriate motor actions during decision-making tasks. However, real-world decisions are invariably multisensory. Where is the relevant multimodal information combined in the brain, and are separate modalities independently represented in frontal cortex?

To answer these questions, we trained mice to perform an audiovisual spatial task where animals turn a wheel to indicate whether a stimulus appeared on the left or right. The stimuli can be auditory, visual, or a combination of the two, presented in coherent or conflicting locations. We optogenetically inactivated different spots across dorsal cortex on individual trials while mice performed this task.

We found that auditory and visual primary sensory cortices were both required for the processing of modality-specific sensory information, and that the effect of inactivation in these regions was highly lateralized. Conversely, inactivation of secondary motor cortex (M2) had robust, modality-independent effects on behavior.

To determine whether frontal cortex contains separate representations of both modalities, or a modality-independent representation of the decision process, we recorded neural activity in M2 with Neuropixels probes in behaving mice. In preliminary analyses, we have observed a variety of response patterns, including neurons that are selective for both spatial location and stimulus modality. Overall, our results suggest a key role for M2 in multisensory decisions.",Philip Coen,"Philip Coen, University College London; Timothy P. Sit, University College London; Miles J.

Up to this date there is no established therapy or pharmaceutical strategy to tackle this mutifactorial condition within the context of neurodegeneration, thus identification of new molecular pathways with neuroprotective action against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis may be proven essential for novel therapeutic approaches. To this end, we identify orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 as a critical protective factor in neuronal cells against H2O2, a well-established oxidative stress model. More specifically, we provide evidence that adenoviral-mediated overexpression of NR5A2 significantly decreases apoptosis and promotes survival of H2O2-treated SH-SY5Y cells and ex vivo cultured murine cortical neurons. Most importantly, dilauroyl-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), an efficient, FDA-approved pharmacological agonist of NR5A2, is sufficient to recapitulate its neuroprotective action in primary neuronal cells. In an attempt to unravel the molecular mechanism of NR5A2 neuroprotective function, we identify key anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl-xl and Bcl-2, as well as genes regulating cellular response to oxidative stress, such Sod2 and Nrf2, as potential downstream targets. Future analyses will include ChIP and transcriptional assays to test the direct binding of NR5A2 on these targets.

recyn158b1TCMnBRo,Symmetric behavior from asymmetric wiring,"Caenorhabditis elegans maintains symmetric dorsal/ventral bending waves for locomotion in all developmental stages, during which its motor circuit undergoes significant rewiring. In adult, cholinergic motor neurons innervate and stimulate body wall muscles, and GABAergic motor neurons contra-laterally inhibit both sides. In the first larval (L1) stage however, a partial electron microscopy reconstruction suggests that cholinergic motor neurons only innervate dorsal muscles, and GABAergic motor neurons only innervate ventral muscles. How does such an asymmetric circuit produce symmetric output? 

To answer this long-standing question, we undertook anatomical and functional analyses of the L1 larva motor circuit. We reconstructed the neural connectivity of a complete L1 larva by electron microscopy, from which we identified previously uncharacterized muscle innervating cells. 

To elucidate the roles of these cells, we developed a novel all-optical manipulation methodology that allows bidirectional and systemic probing of neural circuits. We then combined calcium imaging, cellular ablation, chemogenetics, optogenetics, and all-optical interrogation to pinpoint mechanisms for symmetric muscle output. However, we found that the candidate cells identified from electron microscopy fail to explain output symmetry. Instead, we revealed that it is the excitatory premotor interneurons that provide extrasynaptic cholinergic activation to ventral muscles. Additionally, we found that ventral-innervating motor neurons provide extrasynaptic GABAergic relaxation to dorsal muscles. Thus, extrasynaptic pathways intricately compensate asymmetric synaptic wiring, allowing gait symmetry of newborn larvae.

These findings addressed the question of whether and how a neural circuit is able to operate symmetrically without structural symmetry. Our study highlighted the role of extrasynaptic transmission in regulating behavior, and demonstrated the dual role of both inter- and motor neurons in neuronal circuitry. It is possible that such mechanism is also utilized by other species to maintain stable behavioral output at different developmental stages, and beyond.",Yangning Lu,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology (grid.116068.8),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-27 22:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 22:45:00+00:00,

Due to recent advances in materials and microfabrication methods, modern microelectrodes retain the same basic functionality of traditional microelectrodes but with several important new features, including ultrathin and compliant substrates that lead to reduced tissue damage and improved chronic stability.

recyvOOLknEFbG3XF,Approaching Artificial Intelligence as an Embodied Developmental Process,"In this submission, we will lay out an argument for building artificial intelligence (AI) based on biological development. A developmental AI consists of three components: an embodied input/output network, a critical period for information acquisition and connectivity, and a network topology that expands over time according to the principles of contingency and developmental freedom. Developmental contingency restricts the developmental neural network to an increasingly limited set of possible trajectories. While contingency results in earlier developmental events (cell differentiation) to constrain the range of possibilities for future developmental events (formation of a network motif), developmental freedom is the tendency for information and representations in particular to take advantage of a stable underlying topology. This contributes to an artificial brain that acts as a generative network with a further capacity for behavioral complexity. 

We will demonstrate examples for each of these points using developmental Braitenberg Vehicles (dBVs) as the subject of thought experiments. These thought experiments will take the form of a contingency analysis of a typical dBV input/output network topology. This analysis shows how embodiment developmental agents provide three potentially powerful mechanisms for the emergence of adaptive intelligent systems. First, the presence of an embodied input/output network can act to structure input data. Secondly, the existence of a critical period embedded within the developmental process acts to structure association-building through network complexity. Finally, developmental freedom results from the placement of the critical period within a sequence of events defining the biological developmental process, which in turn can enhance both information acquisition and network structure. In conclusion, we will discuss potential benchmarks and future advances in the developmental approach, including the application of epigenetic landscapes to characterize the formation of a neural network topology.",Jesse Parent,"Bradly Alicea, OpenWorm Foundation, Orthogonal Research and Education Lab; Rishabh Chakrabarty, Manipal Academy Of Higher Education, Orthogonal Research & Education Lab; Akshara Gopi, Manipal Academy Of Higher Education, Orthogonal Research & Education Lab; Anson Lim, Western Michigan University, Orthogonal Research & Education Lab; Furkan Özçelik, Brain and Cognition Research Center in Toulouse, Orthogonal Research & Education Lab ",Orthogonal Research and Education Lab,"Theme D: Cognition, Motivation and Emotion",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 18:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 18:45:00+00:00,
recywZCAuV3BQi63S,Application of Neuroinformatics Pipeline to Gene-environment Interaction in Neurodegenerative Disease,"Background
The presence of the ϵ4 allele of the Apolipoprotein (APOE4) increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is associated with earlier onset of Alzheimer’s disease pathology. The theory of cognitive reserve suggests the existence of a resilience mechanism in the face of neuropathology. A mechanistic relation of cognitive reserve to gray matter density has been implicated where damage to the observable brain is found in the absence of cognitive impairment. The aim of this work was to build neuroinformatics tools to understand the complex interplay between APOE4, resilience, and pathologies.
Methods
Objective 1 of this work was to test whether the effect of cognitive reserve on gray matter density differs by APOE4 genotype. The overall capacity for integrative processing may be associated with cognitive reserve; this was evaluated using a core construct from graph theory called global efficiency. Objective 2 of this work was to test whether a higher cognitive reserve is associated with higher global efficiency. The input of APOE4 status may serve different roles and affect the manner in which the system runs. Objective 3 of this work was to test whether APOE4 carriers as compared to non-carriers demonstrate differences in network recruitment, contributions of global efficiency to functioning. The specific neurophysiological mechanisms that facilitate the effective integration of experience and the development of neuroprotective intellectual abilities are unclear. 
Conclusion
The work presented draws on the methodological strengths of health informatics, biostatistics, and neuroscience, to 1) develop a neuroinformatics pipeline for the replicable collection, manipulation, and analysis of data to produce meaningful and verifiable information, and 2) employ this pipeline to evaluate the potential impact of specific allele carriership on what is recognized as a resilience mechanism for the rest of the population.

recz1l6Bts6Q3YEfh,Spatial profiles of distractors modify saccade trajectories,"Previous research has established how temporal factors and object similarity affect saccade trajectories to targets amongst distractors, but only in a specific spatial configuration. To better understand the spatial factors, we varied the egocentric distribution of targets and distractors while their similarity also varied. Participants had to search for the target out of two objects, both located at the same distance from a central fixation cross, with the distractor placed either clockwise or counterclockwise to the target. We measured the curvature of saccades made to the target using five metrics, analyzing the effects of similarity and angular distance. As the results demonstrated that saccades curve towards the distractor for shorter reaction times and away from the distractor for longer reaction times, we split the data accordingly. We find that as angular distance increases, the saccade curvature decreases. As well, for long reaction times only, as the target-distractor similarity decreases, the saccade curvature away from the distractor increases. These results suggest that visual object discrimination drives saccade trajectories but is also modulated by spatial and temporal factors.

recz9NVKIVhIDhF0C,The impact of advanced age on Mu Opioid Receptor signaling in the midbrain periaqueductal gray: implications on analgesia,"Chronic pain is exceedingly prevalent in individuals over 65 years of age, but is under-managed in this population. The present studies investigated the impact of advanced age on morphine modulation of persistent inflammatory pain in male and female rats. The impact of age, sex, and pain on μ-opioid receptor (MOR) expression and binding in the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG), a critical region in the modulation of pain, was examined using immunohistochemistry and receptor autoradiography. Additionally, we used radioligand binding assays and GTPyS assays to assess the impact of age, sex, and pain on MOR availability and affinity, and MOR induced G-protein activation. Intraplantar administration of Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) induced comparable levels of edema and hyperalgesia in adult (2-3mos) and aged (16-18mos) male and female rats. Morphine potency was highest in adult males, with a two-fold decrease in morphine effective concentration (EC50) observed in aged versus adult males (10.22mg/kg versus 5.19mg/kg). Adult and aged female rats also exhibited significantly higher EC50 values (10.69 mg/kg and 9.00 mg/kg, respectively) compared to adult males. The upward shift in EC50 from adult to aged males was paralleled by a reduction in vlPAG MOR expression and binding. Further, females and aged males exhibited reduced vlPAG MOR binding potential (radioligand binding assay) and reduced G-protein activation efficiency (GTPyS assay) compared to adult males. The observed age-related reductions in morphine potency, vlPAG MOR expression, MOR agonist binding, and opioid induced G-protein activation have significant implications in pain management in the aged population. Our novel findings elucidate the mechanisms responsible for reduced morphine potency in aged animals and identify potential therapeutic targets to improve pain management in the elderly.",Evan Fullerton,"Evan F.

reczA9IMEGhQ51tIe,Economic Choices with Simultaneous or Sequential Offers Rely on the Same Neural Circuit Mechanism,"Economic choices entail assigning values to the available options; a decision is then made by comparing values. Studies in which monkeys chose between two juices identified in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) different groups of cells encoding the value of individual options (offer value), the binary choice outcome (chosen juice) and the chosen value. These variables capture both the input and the output of the choice process, suggesting that these groups of neurons constitute the building blocks of a decision circuit. Experimental and theoretical results support this hypothesis. However, current notions emerged from studies where offers were presented simultaneously; conversely, it was suggested that choices between goods offered (or attended) sequentially rely on different mechanisms. Ballesta et al. recently examined OFC activity during economic decisions under sequential offers. They found different groups of cells seemingly analogous to those identified under simultaneous offers: group1 cells encoded the value of one particular juice whenever that juice was offered; group2 cells encoded the value of the juice currently offered and, subsequently, the chosen value; group3 cells encoded in a binary way the juice type present on the monitor and, subsequently, the chosen juice. Here we directly examined the relation between these cell groups and those previously identified under simultaneous offers. Monkeys performed economic decisions alternating between the two task modalities in a trial-by-trial way. Our results indicate that decisions under sequential offers and under simultaneous offers rely on the same neural circuit.",Weikang Shi,"Weikang Shi, Washington University in St. Louis; Sebastien Ballesta, Washington University in St. Louis; Camillo Padoa-Schioppa, Washington University in St. Louis",Washington University in St. Louis (grid.4367.6),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 22:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 22:45:00+00:00,
reczDw7q1aA1dCm7K,Conserved core visual object recognition across simian primates: Marmoset image-by-image behavior mirrors that of humans and macaques,"Introduced to the field decades ago, marmosets have become an increasingly popular model organism in neuroscience. Among the smallest simian primates, marmosets offer features typically associated with rodents in a species that is phylogenetically closer to humans—e.g., small size (~300 g), flat cortex, and relatively high fecundity. Marmosets may therefore mitigate traditional compromises between an animal model’s methodological tractability and its similarity to humans. Nonetheless, there remain serious concerns that, simian or not, marmosets’ perceptual and cognitive repertoire may be rather limited, particularly in higher-level perception and cognition. Here, we assessed the advanced perceptual abilities of the marmoset in a quintessential domain of systems neuroscience: vision. We quantitatively compared the behavior of three simian primates—marmosets, humans, and macaques—during core visual object recognition, the invariant identification of objects on natural backgrounds despite changes in object scale, position, and pose. We selected this behavior to benchmark the marmoset because it captures a crux problem in natural vision and is computationally challenging. We found that marmosets achieved impressively high performance on this core recognition task, and that their image-by-image behavior was remarkably human-like—indeed, nearly as human-like as was macaques’ (marmoset-human correlation, r = 0.73; macaque-human correlation, r = 0.77). Critically, these kinds of high-level visual behaviors did not seem to extend to rodents—we found that marmosets’ visual capabilities far outstripped those of rats on a simplified object recognition task. Thus, aspects of core high-level perception appear to be shared across simian primates, and marmosets may therefore offer a powerful platform for the study of capabilities conventionally considered to be the exclusive purview of larger primates.

reczGW2MzLmFO0LbW,Surrogate gradients as a link between connectivity and computational function in spiking neural networks,"The brain relies on intricately connected spiking neural networks to solve complex information processing tasks. To understand the principles of this processing, models are indispensable. However, modeling spiking neural networks that mimic a similar computational complexity in-silico has remained challenging due to a lack of theoretical understanding of how neuronal connectivity translates into network-level function. In deep learning, gradient-based algorithms established this link by optimizing objective functions. However, gradient-based methods usually fail in spiking neural networks due to the non-differential nature of spiking neuron models, which precludes gradient computation.
Surrogate gradient learning has emerged as a versatile solution to this problem, allowing us to build functional multi-layer and recurrent spiking neural networks capable of solving diverse computational tasks. Here, I will first motivate and introduce surrogate gradient learning and illustrate how biologically plausible voltage-based three-factor learning rules emerge naturally within this framework. Second, I will showcase the flexibility and remarkable robustness of surrogate gradients on several spike-based information processing problems. Finally, I will show how surrogate gradients allow training spiking neural networks implemented in dedicated neuromorphic hardware, thereby enabling unprecedented processing speed and power-efficiency.

reczGeiq4ia6TPciU,Auditory stimulation during REM sleep modulates cognitive performance.  ,"REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM (NREM) periods are complementary processes constituting the human sleep. NREM has been found to be essential for declarative memory consolidation. There is no conclusive evidence for the cognitive functions of REM sleep although this stage has been associated to procedural memory and emotional arousal[1]. Recently, auditory stimulation during sleep has emerged as an useful method for manipulation of sleep processes, particularly during NREM[2]. Here, we studied the cognitive effects of auditory stimulation during REM. In two overnight conditions (stimulation vs no-stimulation) for 20 subjects, we studied the effect of auditory stimulation during REM. We recorded overnight polysomnography and short auditory clicks were applied locked to eye-movements in EOG during REM. Then, we evaluated changes of overnight performance for each subject in three cognitive tasks: psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), mirror tracing task (MTT) and visual discrimination task (VDT). Using linear random mixed effects analyses, we found that the stimulation increased sleep efficiency (p=0.048) as well as VDT performance (p=0.0092), but detrimental for MTT (p=0.019) and lessened but not significant for PVT (p=0.069). Likewise, the stimulation decreased the eye-movement density during REM (p=0.04) and induced a broadband beta rhythm (15-30Hz) for about 1s after stimulation. Then, followed by a decrease of theta after 0.75s of the stimulus. Interestingly, the induced beta increase was correlated to performance gain of VDT, whereas phasic REM was also correlated to VDT performance in both overnight conditions.  Our findings indicate that acoustic stimulation provides means to modulate REM sleep. Furthermore, the divergent outcomes for cognitive performance suggest REM dynamics underpin different memory processes in different ways.

reczIJE3MZojZ5hnV,P3 component differences between conditions and fluid intelligence effect in 3-stimuli Oddball task,"Oddball task is one of the most popular tasks to study cognitive processing.  
In this study, we aimed to investigate spatio-temporal dynamics of stimulus processing using three-stimuli visual Oddball task. We were interested, if target activates any additional networks / stages of information processing or all steps are the same but differ in temporal dynamics.
We recruited 41 healthy participants and registered high-density 128 active channels EEG. ERP-microstate analysis was applied in order to investigate spatio-temporal dynamics of information processing. 
ERP-microstate analysis revealed that both deviant and target stimuli recruited an additional process which was not present in standard condition. This process was represented by later P3-associated microstate with more central positivity. In contrast, the earlier P3-microstate with more parietal positivity was common between three conditions. Although steps of information processing were similar between deviant and target conditions but conditions differed significantly in temporal dynamics of P3-associated later microstate: it had significantly longer duration and higher amplitude for target compared to deviant stimulus.
Moreover, when we divided our participants into three groups based on their fluid intelligence scores: Low, Medium, High, microstate analysis revealed significant group effect. We observed that the group with lowest scores had significantly higher amplitude of earlier P3-microstate compared to groups with higher scores.
To conclude, earlier P3 component represents a common information processing stage for all conditions while the later P3 component represents additional cognitive processes crucial for target discrimination from a distractor. Interestingly, the common P3 component differentiated group of subjects with lowest fluid  intelligence scores from the two groups with higher scores possibly indicating that subjects with lower scores had to apply more effort to perform the task.

reczJvsTdSZKMfqWi,Lack of latent structure across levels of measurement of positive and negative valence processing in mood and anxiety disorders,"The heterogeneous nature of mood and anxiety disorders has motivated the search for dimensionally based descriptions of psychopathology that can inform better classification and treatment approaches. Following the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach, we sought to derive constructs assessing positive and negative valence domains that are observable in multiple levels of measurement, including self-report, behavioral, physiological, and neural circuit data..

Individuals with clinically impairing mood and anxiety symptoms were recruited largely from primary care clinics (N = 228). Participants completed comprehensive assessments from various domains to measure positive and negative valence processing. Behavioral assessments included emotional reactivity and distress tolerance tasks, during which skin conductance and heart rate were measured. Neuroimaging assessments included fear conditioning and the monetary incentive delay task. Symptomatic assessments included 16 questionnaires assessing various aspects of mood and anxiety symptoms and traits reflecting the negative and positive valence systems.

Group factor analysis (GFA) identified 15 latent variables explaining 26.6% of the variance across all tasks, none of which loaded across levels of measurement or tasks. Instead, variance was best explained by individual latent variables for each unit of analysis within each task. Further analyses suggest that some latent GFA variables are unrelated to the positive and negative valence systems.

The lack of latent structure across levels of measurement and tasks suggests that positive and negative valence processes operate relatively independently across self-report, behavioral, physiological, and neural circuits in clinical populations. While these findings suggest that dimensional approaches work well to reveal within-task features, they do not support the RDoC notion that cross-modality dimensions align in a way that illuminates psychopathology.",JD Knotts,"J.D.

reczNiMVSZqhVqijE,Using a Sparse RNN for dynamic binary classification,"Feedforward network models performing classification tasks rely on highly convergent output units that collect the information passed on by preceding layers.  Although convergent output-unit like neurons may exist in some biological neural circuits, notably the cerebellum, neocortical circuits do not exhibit any obvious candidates for this role, instead they are highly recurrent.  We investigated whether a sparsely connected recurrent network could perform classification in a distributed manner without ever bringing all of the relevant information to a single convergence unit (for an alternative approach see Kushnir, Fusi; 2018).

Our model is based on a sparse RNN that performs the classification dynamically. Specifically, the interconnections of the RNN are trained to resonantly amplify the magnitude of responses to some external inputs but not others.  The amplified and non-amplified responses then form the basis for binary classification.  In this arrangement, the minimum number of synapses per neuron required to reach maximum memory capacity scales only logarithmically with network size. Despite highly sparse connectivity, learned strong recurrent connections allow input information to flow to every neuron of the RNN, providing the basis for the distributed computation.  Furthermore, training allows the model to act as an evidence accumulator. The accumulator robustly maintains its decision for significant periods of time after the input is turned off, although the undriven network stops accumulating information. We studied different training methods and found that back-propagation through time yields the best results.  Our model is robust to various types of noise and works with different activation and loss functions, although certain of these are optimal.  In addition, the RNN can be constructed with a split “excitation–inhibition” architecture with little reduction in performance.",Denis Turcu,"Larry Abbott, Zuckerman Mind Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia Unicersity, New York, NY",Columbia University (grid.21729.3f),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Interactive talk,2020-10-30 12:30:00+00:00,2020-10-30 12:45:00+00:00,
reczO14whILRHnFmK,Neural mechanisms underlying temperature-driven host seeking by a skin-penetrating human-parasitic nematode,"Skin-penetrating parasitic nematodes are a major source of “diseases of disadvantage,” infecting approximately 1 billion people. Their life cycle includes an infective third-larval (iL3) stage that searches for hosts in a poorly understood process involving thermal cues. We measured temperature-driven behaviors in multiple parasitic-nematode species, including the human-parasitic threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis. We found that mammalian-parasitic iL3s are highly sensitive to thermal gradients. At temperatures above their cultivation temperature, iL3s display robust attraction to mammalian body temperatures (37°C). Temperature-driven responses are dominant in multisensory contexts; when below host body temperature, iL3s prioritize temperature-driven behaviors over chemosensory attraction to host odors. 

We leveraged the genetic similarities between S. stercoralis and the free-living model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate mechanisms underlying temperature-driven host seeking. For C. elegans, thermotaxis behaviors within their physiological temperature range (~15-25°C) depend on the Ce-tax-4 gene, which encodes a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit. We showed that targeted mutagenesis of Ss-tax-4 abolishes iL3 heat seeking, suggesting this behavior is generated through adaptations of conserved molecular cascades. In C. elegans, AFD sensory neurons provide the primary thermosensory drive for thermotaxis navigation. We genetically identified the S. stercoralis AFD neurons, and found that inducible silencing of these neurons suppresses iL3 heat seeking. Thus, AFD’s thermosensory role is conserved between S. stercoralis and C. elegans despite species-specific differences in thermal preference, behavior, and AFD dendritic structure. Using genetically encoded calcium sensors, we found that temperature-driven responses in Ss-AFD are distinct from those in Ce-AFD. Furthermore, at least two Ss-AFD-specific receptor guanylate cyclases confer sensitivity to temperature ranges that include mammalian body temperatures, compared to only one in C. elegans. Thus, altered thermal encoding in primary thermosensory neurons likely contributes to parasite-specific behaviors. Together, our results provide insight into the behavioral strategies, neural circuits, and molecular mechanisms that allow skin-penetrating nematodes to target hosts.","Astra Bryant (she, her)","Felicitas Ruiz, UCLA; Elissa Hallem, UCLA",David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA (grid.471398.0),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-29 22:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 22:45:00+00:00,
reczSGWw2RHqikA1i,The Role of Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 in Inhibitory Cortical Interneurons for Processing Ultrasonic Vocalizations,"Background: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Rett Syndrome (RTT) are characterized by impaired communication. RTT is a pervasive, neurodevelopmental disorder previously classified as an ASD and caused by loss of function mutations in the X-linked gene methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2)- a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor critical for maintaining mature neuronal synapses.

Objectives: Our goal is to determine the contribution of cell-type specific Mecp2 mutation to disruptions of auditory cortical circuitry and plasticity that degrade social vocal perception in a mouse model of Rett syndrome.

Methods: To achieve this goal, we will use a cell-type restricted Mecp2 mutant mouse model in combination with a behavioral paradigm that relies on vocal communication. We employ pup retrieval in response to ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs)- a natural, auditory-dependent, learned maternal behavior that we report to be impaired by Mecp2 mutation. USVs emitted by isolated infant pups are high-pitched distress calls that trigger a retrieval response in wild-type (WT) but not non-conditional, Mecp2 heterozygous females. Our previous work suggests that this difference is the result of impaired plasticity in the auditory cortex (ACtx) of Mecp2 mutant animals, a brain region required to detect and interpret vocalizations. ACtx inhibitory interneurons seem to be especially important for processing of socially relevant stimuli (e.g. USVs). Here we build on these findings by selectively inhibiting transcription of Mecp2 protein in specific subclasses of inhibitory interneurons (i.e. parvalbumin-, somatostatin-, and vasoactive intestinal peptide- positive populations) to determine which of these subclasses contributes most toward aberrant auditory processing in the context of our Rett mouse model.

Results: We examine the effects of restricted Mecp2 mutation in inhibitory interneuron subclasses on pup retrieval behavior and in vivo neural circuit activity in the ACtx in response to socially relevant auditory stimuli. We have found Mecp2 mutation restricted to the parvalbumin positive (PV+) cell type is sufficient for impairing pup retrieval behavior. Further, we have found ACtx neuronal activity in response to pup vocalizations are altered in “PV-Mecp2” mutants compared to WT controls similarly to findings from our cell-type non-specific model. These neuronal activity differences are specific to socially relevant sounds (i.e. USVs) as opposed to pure tones.

reczVjwv2sErmFwT2,The effects of dopaminergic psychostimulants on complex problem solving ,"The role of dopaminergic systems in decision-making has been of increasing research interest in recent years. Medications that target these pathways are often used in disorders of attention, and are now also often diverted to non-medical, off-label, and illicit uses in the hope that they will enhance cognition and focus in healthy people. However, research to date reveals a mixed picture of efficacy in this aspect.

We completed a repeated-measures, double-blinded, placebo-controlled single dose trial (PECO: ACTRN12617001544369, U1111-1204-3404) to examine the actions of three indirect dopamine agonists on complex problem-solving performance of healthy adults. Forty participants received 15 mg dextroamphetamine, 30 mg methylphenidate, 200 mg modafinil, or placebo, counterbalanced across 4 testing sessions. In each session, participants completed 16 trials of the Knapsack Task (eight unique instances presented twice each). The Knapsack Task is a NP-hard combinatorial optimisation task, requiring the participant to explore different combinations of items to discover an optimal (maximal) value solution under a specified weight and time constraint.

Mixed-effects modelling of the knapsack decision sequence data revealed that participants took longer to submit solutions in the active drug conditions yet were less likely to find the optimal solution. Participants who performed below-average with placebo explored more solutions while in the active drug conditions, and above-average participants explored less. Closer inspection revealed that the drugs decreased productivity significantly and economically; productivity is the increase in value of the knapsack per item move per unit time. Initial choices, a good predictor of eventual performance in a trial, became more random under active drug conditions. 

These findings suggest that dopaminergic stimulant medications may increase healthy adults’ motivation to spend more time and explore more combinations in pursuit of the solution to a computationally complex problem. However, this often results in decreased performance because exploration becomes more random.

reczakRu9NNCftbex,Mistaking imagination for reality: mental imagery decreases perceptual detection threshold,"Visual experiences can be triggered externally, by signals coming from the outside world during perception; or internally, by signals from memory during mental imagery. Imagery and perception activate similar neural codes in sensory areas, suggesting that they might sometimes be confused. In the current study, we investigated whether imagery influences perception by instructing participants to imagine gratings while externally detecting these same gratings at threshold. In a series of three experiments, we showed that imagery led to a more liberal criterion for reporting stimulus presence, and that this effect was both independent of expectation and stimulus-specific. Furthermore, participants with more vivid imagery were generally more likely to report the presence of external stimuli, independent of condition. The results can be explained as either a low-level sensory or a high-level decision-making effect. We discuss that the most likely explanation is that during imagery, internally generated sensory signals are sometimes confused for perception and suggest how the underlying mechanisms can be further characterized in future research. Our findings show that imagery and perception interact and emphasize that internally and externally generated signals are combined in complex ways to determine conscious perception.

reczipYUdI3LnUw5a,Systematic review and meta-analysis of the calibration of confidence judgments in individuals with schizophrenia,"Background: Metacognitive deficits are well-documented in schizophrenia as a decreased capacity to adjust confidence to first-order performance in a given cognitive task. However, because metacognitive ability directly depends on first-order performance, the observed metacognitive deficits may partly be driven by lower first-order performance. Thus, we hypothesized that studies controlling for first-order performance find smaller metacognitive deficits in schizophrenia.
Method: We conducted a meta-analysis of 43 studies comparing the calibration of confidence in 1458 individuals with schizophrenia compared to 1337  matched controls with a Bayesian model. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were performed to explore how metacognitive deficits depend on task performance, cognitive domains, clinical severity, and treatment dosage.
Results: We found a smaller metacognitive deficit in schizophrenia among studies equating first-order performance between groups. Plus, the metacognitive deficit in non-controlled studies was correlated with first-order performance. No correlations were found between metacognitive deficit and clinical features of schizophrenia.
Conclusion: We provided evidence that the metacognitive deficit in schizophrenia is inflated due to non-equated first-order performance. Thus, efforts should be made to develop experimental protocols accounting for lower first-order performance in schizophrenia.

reczl5mdcGbQk8k2B,Learning complementary inhibitory weight profiles to allow flexible switching,"Multiple types of inhibitory interneurons are found in cortical areas, with stereotypical connectivity motifs that may follow specific plasticity rules. Yet, the combined effect of this diversity on postsynaptic dynamics has been largely unexplored. In this talk, I will present a simple circuit model with a single postsynaptic model neuron receiving tuned excitatory connections alongside inhibition from two plastic populations. In this circuit, synapses from each inhibitory population change according to distinct plasticity rules. I'll present results with different combinations of three rules: Hebbian, anti-Hebbian and homeostatic scaling. Depending on the inhibitory plasticity rule, synapses become unspecific (flat), anti-correlated to, or correlated with excitatory synapses. Crucially, the neuron's receptive field, i.e., its response to presynaptic stimuli, depends on the modulatory state of inhibition. When both inhibitory populations are active, inhibition balances excitation, resulting in uncorrelated postsynaptic responses regardless of the inhibitory tuning profiles, with only transient responses weakly revealing preferred inputs. Modulating the activity of a given inhibitory population produces strong correlations to either preferred or non-preferred inputs, in line with recent experimental findings that show dramatic context-dependent changes of neurons' receptive fields. These results confirm that a neuron's receptive field doesn't follow directly from the weight profiles of its presynaptic afferents, and illustrate how plasticity rules in various cell types can interact to shape cortical circuit motifs and their dynamics.",Everton J Agnes,"Andrea I Luppi, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge; Tim P Vogels, Institute of Science and Technology Austria","Biozentrum, University of Basel","Theme B: Neural Excitability, Synapses, and Glia",Traditional talk,2020-10-27 10:30:00+00:00,2020-10-27 10:45:00+00:00,
reczlGUJ3hOBQ6eWK,Motor and cognitive real-life habits in Parkinson’s disease,"Humans can simultaneously and easily shift between automatic/habitual to voluntary/goal-directed modes of behavioural control. Habits (stimulus-response) allows us to perform well-practiced tasks with minimal or no conscious effort. In Parkinson disease (PD), there is a differential loss of dopamine (DA) along the caudal sensorimotor putamen initially transferring to more rostral regions as the disease progresses. The sensoriomotor putamen is primarily implicated in habitual control of behaviour therefore possibly explaining some motor deficits in PD such as arm swinging, walking and writing.
Our aim was to to investigate with a more ecological approach whether early dopaminergic cell loss in PD (a) alters real-life motor habits and (b) if as well cognitive real-life habits are impaired in PD compared to controls.
We measured habitual behaviour in 14 early PD patients and 14 HC during performance of a natural habitual motor (handwriting, one of the most well-learned and automatic tasks) and cognitive tasks (Go/noGo Associations Tasks GNAT on implicit prejudice). Tasks were developed to differentiate between habitual and goal directed components. In the writing task, we collected data from the most automatic (e.g. signature, Spanish) to more goal-directed conditions (e.g. Polish, Greek). In the GNAT, we used four kind of stimuli to create four possible Go conditions: two congruent and two incongruent associated to familiar and unfamiliar associations.
In the natural habitual motor task (handwriting), PD patients showed reduced automatism in the execution of habitual conditions (Spanish and signature writing) compared to controls. However, in the cognitive habitual task, results reveal similar habitual responses in both groups, showing faster responses for congruent conditions than incongruent ones. 
Our results suggest larger differences in the motor domain in real-life habits whereas the cognitive one remains unaffected in early PD, indicative of specific deficient use of motor habits in PD.

reczp6HRTD8uf2lwU,Standardized and reproducible measurement of decision-making in mice,"Progress in science requires standardized assays whose results can be readily shared, compared, and reproduced across laboratories. Reproducibility, however, has been a concern in neuroscience, particularly for measurements of mouse behavior. We show that a standardized task to probe decision-making in mice produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. We designed a task for head-fixed mice that combines established assays of perceptual and value-based decision making, and we standardized training protocol and experimental hardware, software, and procedures. We trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, and we collected 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database. Learning speed was variable across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, on past successes and failures, and on estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be successfully reproduced across multiple laboratories. They establish a standard for reproducible rodent behavior, and provide an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice. More generally, they indicate a path towards achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches.

reczqoMWNXzIPNBpr,Frequency-Dependent Force Direction Elucidates Neural Control of Balance,"Balance is an unstable task that requires control of translational and rotational motions. Humans use foot-ground interaction force, characterized by direction, point of application, and magnitude, to manage body accelerations. Previous work identified a point of intersection of foot-ground interaction forces that exhibited consistent frequency-dependent behavior across multiple subjects. To test whether this frequency-dependent behavior provided a distinctive signature of neural control or was a necessary consequence of biomechanics, this study simulated quiet standing and compared the results with human subject data. If a standing human was modeled as a single inverted pendulum, no controller could reproduce the experimentally observed frequency-dependence of the intersection point. The simplest competent model that approximated a standing human was a double inverted pendulum with torque-actuated ankle and hip joints. It was stabilized by a linear feedback controller based on position and velocity errors of each joint. Numerous controller parameter sets could stabilize this model and produce a change in vertical position of the intersection point with increasing frequency; the observed decrease in height appears to reflect a biomechanical constraint. However, a controller that best reproduced the results observed in human standing used minimal effort and more ankle torque than hip torque. These observations imply that human subjects employed a neural strategy that prioritizes the use of the ankle torque and minimizes overall control effort to balance.",Kaymie Shiozawa,"Kaymie Shiozawa, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Jongwoo Lee, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Marta Russo, Departments of Biology, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Physics, Northeastern University; Dagmar Sternad, Departments of Biology, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Physics, Northeastern University; Neville Hogan, Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (grid.116068.8),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Interactive talk,2020-10-29 21:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 21:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/3GsDEJoHRJE
reczuHsZG7MkRDGAg,Synapse size as a gate between stable and switch-like behaviour,"Synapses comprise a small cellular compartment known as the postsynaptic density, which is the site of a number of extensively characterised biochemical processes involved in neuronal communication, learning and memory storage. Many biomolecular systems operate in the small system size regime, where the number of interacting molecules is in the tens or hundreds. In this regime, the inherent randomness of chemical reactions has an overall larger effect which raises the question of how synapses can signal reliably and store information over extended periods.

An important consequence of randomness in biochemical systems is that in the small system size regime, they can have multiple modes even if they only have a single mode in the large system size regime, that is, in the mass-action (deterministic) limit. This raises the possibility that compartmentalization can be exploited by biological systems to realise switch-like computations.

We illustrate this on a well-known test system, the toggle switch. The toggle switch is a continuous-time birth-death process describing the volume of two chemical species that mutually inhibit each other. This process possesses a single stable equilibrium in the mass action limit and exhibits bimodality for small system sizes. We explore a new heuristic approach to predicting the emergence of multimodality in nonlinear biochemical reactions in the small system size regime. In generic examples we show that there is a critical system size that separates unimodal and multi-modal behaviour that can be estimated by using linear noise approximation.

By considering the system size as a time-dependent control variable, our results support that system size may drive biochemical systems between stable uni-modal and switch-like multi-modal behaviour. Crucially, synapses are observed to increase in volume when potentiated, raising the possibility that system size may be exploited by synapses to achieve reliable switches despite the randomness in the underlying biochemical components.",Monika Jozsa,"Tihol Ivanov Donchev, University of Cambridge; Rodolphe Sepulchre, University of Cambridge;  Timothy O'Leary, University of Cambridge",University of Cambridge (grid.5335.0),Theme E: Computational modelling and Techniques,Traditional talk,2020-10-29 16:30:00+00:00,2020-10-29 16:45:00+00:00,https://youtu.be/lQ2FkO2l2RY
reczxW8vBV9wqsmao,Electrophysiology of Affordances,"Affordances, in scientific literature have largely been treated either as psychophysical action schema or as visual percept abstractions. The neurobiology of affordances is not well-understood. In this paper, we attempt to explain the neurobiology of affordances through a simplified observational model, defined in terms of electrophysiology. In particular, we analyze affordances using cerebral electrophysiology measurements, namely electroencephalography (EEG) and arm muscular electrophysiology measurements, namely electromyography (EMG). Fourier and Wavelet based analysis of EEG measurements from 5 participants during 12 affordance executions across three modes - observational, simulated and ego-execution demonstrate two key effects. Firstly, these sensorimotor EEG affordance codes are distinct and uniquely discriminant across the affordance categories. Secondly, the affordance codes show a high-degree of similarity across the three execution modes, indicating the role of mirror neuronal behavior in affordance processing in the brain. On the other hand, EMG measurements across 33 different grasp affordance executions (as defined by KTH grasp taxonomy), show a high degree of overlap, especially across precision pinch grasp types. This indicates that EMG based motor codes may be insufficient in modeling  sensorimotor affordance codes and the wider diversity of EEG codes is likely to be necessary in successful characterization.",Karthik Mahesh Varadarajan,,King's College London (grid.13097.3c),"Theme C: Sensory & Motor Systems, and Physiology/Behavior",Traditional talk,2020-10-30 08:30:00+00:00,2020-10-30 08:45:00+00:00,
